<h2>FOREWORD</h2>

<h3><i>How Scouting Began</i></h3>


<p><i>"How did Scouting come to be used by girls?" That is what
I have been asked. Well, it was this way. In the beginning
I had used Scouting&mdash;that is, wood craft, handiness, and cheery
helpfulness&mdash;as a means for training young soldiers when
they first joined the army, to help them become handy, capable
men and able to hold their own with anyone instead of being
mere drilled machines.</i></p>

<p><i>You have read about the Wars in your country against
the Red Indians, of the gallantry of your soldiers against
the cunning of the Red Man, and what is more, of the pluck
of your women on those dangerous frontiers.</i></p>

<p><i>Well, we have had much the same sort of thing in South
Africa. Over and over again I have seen there the wonderful
bravery and resourcefulness of the women when the tribes of
Zulu or Matabeles have been out on the war path against the
white settlers.</i></p>

<p><i>In the Boer war a number of women volunteered to help
my forces as nurses or otherwise; they were full of pluck
and energy, but unfortunately they had never been trained
to do anything, and so with all the good-will in the world they
were of no use. I could not help feeling how splendid it
would be if one could only train them in peace time in the
same way one trained the young soldiers&mdash;that is, through
Scoutcraft.</i></p>

<p><i>I afterwards took to training boys in that way, but I had
not been long at it before the girls came along, and offered
to do the very thing I had hoped for, they wanted to take up
Scouting also.</i></p>

<p><i>They did not merely want to be imitators of the boys;
they wanted a line of their own.</i></p>

<p><i>So I gave them a smart blue uniform and the names of
"Guides" and my sister wrote an outline of the scheme. The
name Guide appealed to the British girls because the pick of
our frontier forces in India is the Corps of Guides. The term
cavalry or infantry hardly describes it since it is composed
of all-round handy men ready to take on any job in the
campaigning line and do it well.</i></p>

<p><i>Then too, a woman who can be a good and helpful comrade
to her brother or husband or son along the path of life is
really a guide to him.</i></p>

<p><i>The name Guide therefore just describes the members of
our sisterhood who besides being handy and ready for any
kind of duty are also a jolly happy family and likely to be
good, cheery comrades to their mankind.</i></p>

<p><i>The coming of the Great War gave the Girl Guides their
opportunity, and they quickly showed the value of their
training by undertaking a variety of duties which made them
valuable to their country in her time of need.</i></p>

<p><i>My wife, Lady Baden-Powell, was elected by the members
to be the Chief Guide, and under her the movement has gone
ahead at an amazing pace, spreading to most foreign countries.</i></p>

<p><i>It is thanks to Mrs. Juliette Low, of Savannah, that the
movement was successfully started in America, and though
the name Girl Scouts has there been used it is all part of the
same sisterhood, working to the same ends and living up to
the same Laws and Promise.</i></p>

<p><i>If all the branches continue to work together and become
better acquainted with each other as they continue to become
bigger it will mean not only a grand step for the sisterhood,
but what is more important it will be a real help toward
making the new League of Nations a living force.</i></p>

<p><i>How can that be? In this way:</i></p>

<p><i>If the women of the different nations are to a large extent
members of the same society and therefore in close touch and
sympathy with each other, although belonging to different
countries, they will make the League a real bond not merely
between the Governments, but between the Peoples themselves
and they will see to it that it means Peace and that we have
no more of War.</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The present edition of "Scouting for Girls" is the result
of collaboration on the part of practical workers in
the organization from every part of the country. The
endeavor on the part of its compilers has been to combine
the minimum of standardization necessary for dignified
and efficient procedure, with the maximum of freedom
for every local branch in its interpretation and practice
of the Girl Scout aims and principles.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgments are due to the following:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Miss Sarah Louise Arnold, Dean, and Miss Ula M. Dow,
A.M., and Dr. Alice Blood, of Simmons College for the
Part of Section XI entitled "Home Economics"; Sir Robert
Baden-Powell for frequent references and excerpts
from "Girl Guiding"; Dr. Samuel Lambert for the Part
on First Aid, Section XI, and Dr. W. H. Rockwell for
reading and criticizing this; Miss Marie Johnson with the
assistance of Miss Isabel Stewart of Teachers College,
for the Part entitled "Home Nursing" in Section XI; Dr.
Herman M. Biggs for reading and criticizing the Parts
dealing with Public Health and Child Care; Mr. Ernest
Thompson Seton and The Woodcraft League, and Doubleday,
Page &amp; Co. for Section XIII and plates on "Woodcraft";
Mr. Joseph Parsons, Mr. James Wilder, Mrs.
Eloise Roorbach, and Mr. Horace Kephart and the
Macmillan Company for the material in Section XIV
"Camping for Girl Scouts"; Mr. George H. Sherwood,
Curator, and Dr. G. Clyde Fisher, Associate Curator, of
the Department of Public Education of the American
Museum of Natural History for the specially prepared
Section XV and illustrations on "Nature Study," and for
all proficiency tests in this subject; Mr. David Hunter
for Section XVI "The Girl Scout's Own Garden," and
Mrs. Ellen Shipman for the part on a perennial border
with the specially prepared drawing, in the Section on the
Garden; Mr. Sereno Stetson for material in Section XVII
"Measurements, Map Making and Knots"; Mr. Austin
Strong for pictures of knots; Mrs. Raymond Brown for
the test for Citizen; Miss Edith L. Nichols, Supervisor of
Drawing in the New York Public Schools, for the test on
Craftsman; Mr. John Grolle of the Settlement Music
School, Philadelphia, for assistance in the Music test;
Miss Eckhart for help in the Farmer test; The Camera
Club and the Eastman Kodak Company for the test for
Photographer; Mrs. Frances Hunter Elwyn of the New
York School of Fine and Applied Arts, for devising and
drawing certain of the designs for Proficiency Badges
and the plates for Signalling; Miss L. S. Power, Miss
Mary Davis and Miss Mabel Williams of the New York
Public Library, for assistance in the preparation of reference
reading for Proficiency Tests, and general reading
for Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>It is evident that only a profound conviction of the
high aims of the Girl Scout movement and the practical
capacity of the organization for realizing them could
have induced so many distinguished persons to give so
generously of their time and talent to this Handbook.</p>

<p>The National Executive Board, under whose auspices
it has been compiled, appreciate this and the kindred
courtesy of the various organizations of similar interests,
most deeply. We feel that such hearty and friendly cooperation
on the part of the community at large is the
greatest proof of the vitality and real worth of this and
allied movements, based on intelligent study of the young
people of our country.</p>

<h2>SECTION I</h2>

<h3>HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN GIRL SCOUTS</h3>

<p>When Sir Robert Baden-Powell founded the Boy
Scout movement in England, it proved too attractive and
too well adapted to youth to make it possible to limit its
great opportunities to boys alone. The sister organization,
known in England as the Girl Guides, quickly followed
and won an equal success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Juliette Low, an American visitor in England,
and a personal friend of the Father of Scouting, realized
the tremendous future of the movement for her own
country, and with the active and friendly co-operation of
the Baden-Powells, she founded the Girl Guides in
America, enrolling the first patrols in Savannah, Georgia,
in March 1912. In 1915 National Headquarters were
established in Washington, D. C., and the name was
changed to Girl Scouts.</p>

<p>In 1916 National Headquarters were moved to New
York and the methods and standards of what was plainly
to be a nation-wide organization became established on
a broad, practical basis.</p>

<p>The first National Convention was held in 1915, and
each succeeding year has shown a larger and more enthusiastic
body of delegates and a public more and more
interested in this steadily growing army of girls and
young women who are learning in the happiest way how
to combine patriotism, outdoor activities of every kind,
skill in every branch of domestic science and high standards
of community service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Every side of the girl's nature is brought out and developed
by enthusiastic Captains, who direct their games
and various forms of training, and encourage team-work
and fair play. For the instruction of the Captains national
camps and training schools are being established
all over the country; and schools and churches everywhere
are cooperating eagerly with this great recreational
movement, which, they realize, adds something to the
life of the growing girl that they have not been able to
supply.</p>

<p>Colleges are offering training in scouting as a serious
course for prospective officers, and prominent citizens in
every part of the country are identifying themselves
with the Local Councils, in an advisory and helpful
capacity.</p>

<p>At the present writing nearly 107,000 girls and more
than 8,000 Officers represent the original little troop
in Savannah&mdash;surely a satisfying sight for our Founder
and First President, when she realizes what a healthy
sprig she has transplanted from the Mother Country!</p>

<h3>PRINCIPLES OF THE GIRL SCOUTS</h3>


<div class='center'><br />The Motto:<br />

<b>Be Prepared</b></div>

<p>A Girl Scout learns to swim, not only as an athletic
accomplishment, but so that she can save life. She passes
her simple tests in child care and home nursing and
household efficiency in order to be ready for the big
duties when they come. She learns the important facts
about her body, so as to keep it the fine machine it was
meant to be. And she makes a special point of woodcraft
and camp lore, not only for the fun and satisfaction
they bring, in themselves, but because they are the
best emergency course we have today. A Girl Scout
who has passed her First Class test is as ready to help
herself, her home and her Country as any girl of her
age should be expected to prove.</p>


<div class='center'><br />The Slogan:<br />

<b>"Do a Good Turn Daily"</b></div>

<p>This simple recipe for making a very little girl perform
every day some slight act of kindness for somebody
else is the <i>seed</i> from which grows the larger <i>plant</i> of
helping the world along&mdash;the steady attitude of the older
Scout. And this grows later into the great tree of organized,
practical community service for the grown Scout&mdash;the
ideal of every American woman today.</p>


<div class='center'><br />The Pledge:</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>"I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the
Republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."</b></p></div>

<p>This pledge, though not original with the Girl Scouts,
expresses in every phrase their principles and practice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Practical patriotism, in war and peace, is the cornerstone
of the organization. A Girl Scout not only knows
how to make her flag, and how to fly it; she knows how
to respect it and is taught how to spread its great lesson
of democracy. Many races, many religions, many classes
of society have tested the Girl Scout plan and found
that it has something fascinating and helpful in it for
every type of young girl.</p>

<p>This broad democracy is American in every sense of
the word; and the Patrol System, which is the keynote
of the organization, by which eight girls of about the
same age and interests elect their Patrol Leader and
practice local self-government in every meeting, carries
out American ideals in practical detail.</p>


<div class='center'><br />The Promise:</div>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Promise">
<tr><td align='center'><b>On My Honor I will try:</b></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>To do my duty to God and my country.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>To help other people at all times.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>To obey the Scout Laws.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>This binds the Scouts together as nothing else could
do. It is a promise each girl <i>voluntarily</i> makes; it is not
a rule of her home nor a command from her school nor
a custom of her church. She is not forced to make it&mdash;she
deliberately chooses to do so. And like all such
promises, it means a great deal to her. Experience has
shown that she hesitates to break it.</p>


<h3><br />THE LAWS OF THE GIRL SCOUTS</h3>

<div class='center'><b>I. A Girl Scout's Honor Is To Be Trusted</b></div>

<p>This means that a Girl Scout's standards of honor
are so high and sure that no one would dream of doubting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
her simple statement of a fact when she says: "This
is so, on my honor as a Girl Scout."</p>

<p>She is not satisfied, either, with keeping the letter of
the law, when she really breaks it in spirit. When she
answers you, <i>she</i> means what <i>you</i> mean.</p>

<p>Nor does she take pains to do all this only when she is
watched, or when somebody stands ready to report on
her conduct. This may do for some people, but not for
the Scouts. You can go away and leave her by herself
at any time; she does not require any guard but her own
sense of honor, which is always to be trusted.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>II. A Girl Scout Is Loyal</b></div>

<p>This means that she is true to her Country, to the
city or village where she is a citizen, to her family, her
church, her school, and to those for whom she may work,
or who may work for her. She is bound to believe the
best of them and to defend them if they are slandered or
threatened. Her belief in them may be the very thing
they need most, and they must feel that whoever may
fail them, a Girl Scout never will.</p>

<p>This does not mean that she thinks her friends and
family and school are perfect; far from it. But there
is a way of standing up for what is dear to you, even
though you admit that it has its faults. And if you insist
on what is best in people, behind their backs, they
will be more likely to take your criticism kindly, when
you make it to their faces.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>III. A Girl Scout's Duty Is To Be Useful and to Help Others</b></div>

<p>This means that if it is a question of being a help to
the rest of the world, or a burden on it, a Girl Scout is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
always to be found among the helpers. The simplest
way of saying this, for very young Scouts, is to tell them
to do a GOOD TURN to someone every day they live;
that is, to be a <i>giver</i> and not a <i>taker</i>. Some beginners
in Scouting, and many strangers, seem to think that any
simple act of courtesy, such as we all owe to one another,
counts as a good turn, or that one's mere duty to
one's parents is worthy of Scout notice. But a good
Scout laughs at this idea, for she knows that these things
are expected of all decent people. She wants to give
the world every day, for good measure, something over
and above what it asks of her. And the more she does,
the more she sees to do.</p>

<p>This is the spirit that makes the older Scout into a
fine, useful, dependable woman, who does so much good
in her community that she becomes naturally one of its
leading citizens, on whom everyone relies, and of whom
everyone is proud. It may end in the saving of a life, or
in some great heroic deed for one's country. <i>But these
things are only bigger expressions of the same feeling
that makes the smallest Tenderfoot try to do at least one
good turn a day.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>IV. A Girl Scout Is a Friend to All, and a Sister to Every Other Girl Scout</b></div>

<p>This means that she has a feeling of good will to all
the world, and is never offish and suspicious nor inclined
to distrust other people's motives. A Girl Scout should
never bear a grudge, nor keep up a quarrel from pride,
but look for the best in everybody, in which case she
will undoubtedly find it. Women are said to be inclined
to cliques and snobbishness, and the world looks to great
organizations like the Girl Scouts to break down their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
petty barriers of race and class and make our sex a great
power for democracy in the days to come.</p>

<p>The Girl Scout finds a special comrade in every other
Girl Scout, it goes without saying, and knows how to
make her feel that she need never be without a friend,
or a meal, or a helping hand, as long as there is another
Girl Scout in the world.</p>

<p>She feels, too, a special responsibility toward the very
old, who represent what she may be, some day; toward
the little children, who remind her of what she used to be;
toward the very poor and the unfortunate, either of
which she may be any day. The sick and helpless she
has been, as a Scout, especially trained to help, and she is
proud of her handiness and knowledge in this way.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>V. A Girl Scout Is Courteous</b></div>

<p>This means that it is not enough for women to be helpful
in this world; they must do it pleasantly. The greatest
service is received more gratefully if it is rendered
graciously. The reason for this is that true courtesy is
not an affected mannerism, but a sign of real consideration
of the rights of others, a very simple proof that
you are anxious to "do as you would be done by." It
is society's way of playing fair and giving everybody
a chance. In the same way, a gentle voice and manner
are very fair proofs of a gentle nature; the quiet, self-controlled
person is not only mistress of herself, but in
the end, of all the others who cannot control themselves.</p>

<p>And just as our great statesman, Benjamin Franklin
proved that "honesty is the best policy," so many a successful
woman has proved that a pleasant, tactful manner
is one of the most valuable assets a girl can possess,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and should be practised steadily. At home, at school,
in the office and in the world in general, the girl with the
courteous manner and pleasant voice rises quickly in
popularity and power above other girls of equal talent
but less politeness. Girl Scouts lay great stress on this,
because, though no girl can make herself beautiful, and
no girl can learn to be clever, <i>any girl can learn to be
polite</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>VI. A Girl Scout Is a Friend to Animals</b></div>

<p>All Girl Scouts take particular care of our dumb
friends, the animals, and are always eager to protect
them from stupid neglect or hard usage. This often leads
to a special interest in their ways and habits, so that a
Girl Scout is likely to know more about these little
brothers of the human race than an ordinary girl.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>VII. A Girl Scout Obeys Orders</b></div>

<p>This means that you should obey those to whom obedience
is due, through thick and thin. If this were not an
unbreakable rule, no army could endure for a day. It
makes no difference whether you are cleverer, or
older, or larger, or richer than the person who may be
elected or appointed for the moment to give you orders;
once they are given, it is your duty to obey them. And
the curious thing about it is that the quicker and better
you obey these orders, the more quickly and certainly
you will show yourself fitted to give them when your
time comes. The girl or woman who cannot obey can
never govern. The reason you obey the orders of your
Patrol Leader, for instance, in Scout Drill, is not that
she is better than you, but because she happens to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
your Patrol Leader, and gives her orders as she would
obey yours were you in her place.</p>

<p>A small well trained army can always conquer and
rule a big, undisciplined mob, and the reason for this is
simply because the army has been taught to obey and to
act in units, while the mob is only a crowd of separate
persons, each doing as he thinks best. The soldier obeys
by instinct, in a great crisis, only because he has had
long practice in obeying when it was a question of unimportant
matters. So the army makes a great point of
having everything ordered in military drill, carried out
with snap and accuracy; and the habit of this, once fixed,
may save thousands of lives when the great crisis comes,
and turn defeat into victory.</p>

<p>A good Scout must obey instantly, just as a good
soldier must obey his officer, or a good citizen must
obey the law, with no question and no grumbling. If
she considers any order unjust or unreasonable, let her
make complaint through the proper channels, and she
may be sure that if she goes about it properly she will
receive attention. <i>But she must remember to obey first
and complain afterward.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>VIII. A Girl Scout Is Cheerful</b></div>

<p>This means that no matter how courteous or obedient
or helpful you try to be, if you are sad or depressed
about it nobody will thank you very much for your
effort. A laughing face is usually a loved face, and
nobody likes to work with a gloomy person. Cheerful
music, cheerful plays and cheerful books have always
been the world's favorites; and a jolly, good-natured
girl will find more friends and more openings in the
world than a sulky beauty or a gloomy genius.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been scientifically proved that if you deliberately
<i>make</i> your voice and face cheerful and bright you immediately
begin to feel that way; and as cheerfulness is
one of the most certain signs of good health, a Scout
who appears cheerful is far more likely to keep well
than one who lets herself get "down in the mouth."
There is so much real, unavoidable suffering and sorrow
in the world that nobody has any right to add to them
unnecessarily, and "as cheerful as a Girl Scout" ought
to become a proverb.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>IX. A Girl Scout Is Thrifty</b></div>

<p>This means that a Girl Scout is a girl who is wise
enough to know the value of things and to put them to
the best use. The most valuable thing we have in this
life is time, and girls are apt to be stupid about getting
the most out of it. A Girl Scout may be known by the
fact that she is either working, playing or resting. All
are necessary and one is just as important as the other.</p>

<p>Health is probably a woman's greatest capital, and a
Girl Scout looks after it and saves it, and doesn't waste
it by poor diet and lack of exercise and fresh air, so that
she goes bankrupt before she is thirty.</p>

<p>Money is a very useful thing to have, and the Girl
Scout decides how much she can afford to save and
does it, so as to have it in an emergency. A girl who
saves more than she spends may be niggardly; a girl
who spends more than she saves may go in debt. A Girl
Scout saves, as she spends, on some system.</p>

<p>Did you ever stop to think that no matter how much
money a man may earn, the women of the family generally
have the spending of most of it? And if they
have not learned to manage their own money sensibly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
how can they expect to manage other people's? If every
Girl Scout in America realized that she might make all
the difference, some day, between a bankrupt family and
a family with a comfortable margin laid aside for a rainy
day, she would give a great deal of attention to this Scout
law.</p>

<p>In every great war all nations have been accustomed
to pay the costs of the war from loans; that is, money
raised by the savings of the people. Vast sums were
raised in our own country during the great war by such
small units as Thrift Stamps. If the Girl Scouts could
save such wonderful sums as we know they did in war,
why can they not keep this up in peace? For one is as
much to their Country's credit as the other.</p>

<span class="caption">SALUTING THE FLAG IN A GIRL SCOUT CAMP</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>X. A Girl Scout Is Clean in Thought, Word and Deed</b></div>

<p>This means that just as she stands for a clean, healthy
community and a clean, healthy home, so every Girl
Scout knows the deep and vital need for clean and
healthy bodies in the mothers of the next generation.
This not only means keeping her skin fresh and sweet
and her system free from every impurity, but it goes
far deeper than this, and requires every Girl Scout to
respect her body and mind so much that she forces
everyone else to respect them and keep them free from
the slightest familiarity or doubtful stain.</p>

<p>A good housekeeper cannot endure dust and dirt; a
well cared for body cannot endure grime or soil; a pure
mind cannot endure doubtful thoughts that cannot be
freely aired and ventilated. It is a pretty safe rule for
a Girl Scout not to read things nor discuss things nor do
things that could not be read nor discussed nor done
by a Patrol all together. If you will think about this, you
will see that it does not cut out anything that is really
necessary, interesting or amusing. Nor does it mean
that Scouts <i>should</i> never do anything except in Patrols;
that would be ridiculous. But if they find they <i>could</i>
not do so, they had better ask themselves why. When
there is any doubt about this higher kind of cleanliness
Captains and Councillors may always be asked for advice
and explanation.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2>SECTION III</h2>

<h2>ORGANIZATION OF THE GIRL SCOUTS</h2>


<h3>Lone Scout</h3>

<p>The basis of the Girl Scout organization is the individual
girl. Any one girl anywhere who wishes to enroll
under our simple pledge of loyalty to God and Country,
helpfulness to other people and obedience to the Scout
Laws, and is unable to attach herself to any local group,
is privileged to become a Lone Scout. The National
Organization will do its best for her and she is eligible
for all Merit Badges which do not depend upon group
work.</p>


<h3><br />Patrol</h3>

<p>But the ideal unit and the keystone of the organization
is the Patrol, consisting of eight girls who would
naturally be associated as friends, neighbors, school fellows
or playmates. They are a self selected and, under
the regulations and customs of the organization, a self
governing little body, who learn, through practical experiment,
how to translate into democratic team-play,
their recreation, patriotic or community work, camp
life and athletics. Definite mastery of the various subjects
they select to study is made more interesting by
healthy competition and mutual observation.</p>


<h3><br />Patrol Leader</h3>

<p>Each Patrol elects from its members a Patrol Leader,
who represents them and is to a certain extent responsible
for the discipline and dignity of the Patrol.</p>


<h3><br />Corporal</h3>

<p>The Patrol Leader is assisted by her Corporal, who may
be either elected or appointed; and she is subject to re-election<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
at regular intervals, the office is a practical symbol
of the democratic basis of our American government
and a constant demonstration of it.</p>


<h3><br />Troop</h3>

<p>From one to four of these Patrols constitute a Troop,
the administrative unit of the organization. Girl Scouts
are registered and chartered by troops, and the Troop
meeting is their official gathering. The Troop has the
privilege of owning a flag and choosing from a list of
flowers, trees, birds, and so forth, its own personal crest
and title.</p>


<h3><br />Captain</h3>

<p>The leader is called a Captain. She must be twenty-one
or over, and officially accepted by the National Headquarters,
from whom she receives the ratification of her
appointment and to whom she is responsible. She may
be chosen by the girls themselves, suggested by local
authorities, or be herself the founder of the Troop. She
represents the guiding, friendly spirit of comradely leadership,
the responsibility and discretion, the maturer
judgment and the definite training which shapes the policy
of the organization.</p>


<h3><br />Lieutenants</h3>

<p>She may, in a small troop, and should, in a large one,
be assisted by a Lieutenant, who must be eighteen or over,
and who must, like herself, be commissioned from National
Headquarters; and if desired, by a Second Lieutenant,
who must be at least sixteen.</p>


<h3><br />Council</h3>

<p>The work of the Girl Scouts in any community is made
many times more effective and stimulating by the cooperation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the Council, a group of interested, public
spirited citizens who are willing to stand behind the girls
and lend the advantages of their sound judgment, broad
point of view, social prestige and financial advice. They
are not expected to be responsible for any teaching, training
or administrative work; they are simply the organized
Friends of the Scouts and form the link between the
Scouts and the community. The Council is at its best
when it is made up of representatives of the church,
school, club and civic interests of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'nieghborhood'">neighborhood</ins>,
and can be of inestimable value in suggesting and affording
means of co-operation with all other organizations,
patronizing and advertising Scout entertainments, and so
forth. One of its chief duties is that of finding interested
and capable judges for the various Merit Badges, and
arranging for the suitable conferring of such badges.
The Council, or a committee selected from its members,
is known for this purpose as the Court of Awards.</p>

<p>A Captain who feels that she has such a body behind
her can go far with her Troop; and citizens who are
particularly interested in constructive work with young
people who find endless possibilities in an organized Girl
Scout Council. The National Headquarters issues
charters to such Councils and cooperates with them in
every way.</p>


<h3><br />National Organization</h3>

<p>The central and final governing body is the National
Council. This is made up of delegates elected from all
local groups throughout the country, and works by representation,
indirectly through large State and District
sub-divisions, through the National Executive Board
which maintains its Headquarters in New York.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />National Director</h3>

<p>The National Director is in charge of these Headquarters
and directs the administrative work under the
general heading of Field, Business, Publication and
Education.</p>


<h3><br />Policy</h3>

<p>From the youngest Lone Scout up to the National
Director, the organization is democratic, self-governing
and flexible, adjusting itself everywhere and always to
local circumstances and the habits and preferences of
the different groups. It is not only non-sectarian, but
is open to all creeds and has the enthusiastic support of
all of them. It offers no new system of education, but
co-operates with the schools and extends to them a much
appreciated recreational plan. It affords the churches a
most practical outlet for their ideals for their young
people. Its encouragement of the intelligent domestic
interests is shown by the stress laid on every aspect of
home and social life and by the great variety of Merit
Badges offered along these lines. The growing interest
in the forming of Girl Scout Troops by schools, churches
and parents proves as nothing else could, how naturally
and helpfully this simple organization fits in with the
three factors of the girl's life; her home, her church, her
school. And the rapid and never ceasing growth of the
Girl Scouts means that we are able to offer, every year,
larger and larger numbers of healthy and efficient young
citizens to their country.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>SECTION IV</h2>

<h3>WHO ARE THE SCOUTS?</h3>

<p>In the early days of this great country of ours, before
telephones and telegrams, railroads and automobiles made
communications of all sorts so easy, and help of all kinds
so quickly secured, men and women&mdash;yes, and boys and
girls, too!&mdash;had to depend very much on themselves and
be very handy and resourceful, if they expected to keep
safe and well, and even alive.</p>

<p>Our pioneer grandmothers might have been frightened
by the sight of one of our big touring cars, for instance,
or puzzled as to how to send a telegram, but they knew
an immense number of practical things that have been
entirely left out of our town-bred lives, and for pluck and
resourcefulness in a tight place it is to be doubted if we
could equal them today.</p>

<p>"<i>You press a button and we do the rest</i>" is the slogan
of a famous camera firm, and really it seems as if this
might almost be called the slogan of modern times; we
have only to press a button nowadays, and someone will
do the rest.</p>

<p>But in those early pioneer days there was no button to
press, as we all know, and nobody to "do the rest": everybody
had to know a little about everything <i>and be able to
do that little pretty quickly</i>, as safety and even life might
depend upon it.</p>

<p>The men who stood for all this kind of thing in the
highest degree were probably the old "Scouts," of whom
Natty Bumpo, in Cooper's famous old Indian tales is the
great example. They were explorers, hunters, campers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
builders, fighters, settlers, and in an emergency, nurses
and doctors combined. They could cook, they could sew,
they could make and sail a canoe, they could support
themselves indefinitely in the trackless woods, they knew
all the animals and the plants for miles around, they could
guide themselves by the sun, and stars, and finally, they
were husky and hard as nails and always in the best of
health and condition. Their adventurous life, always on
the edge of danger and new, unsuspected things, made
them as quick as lightning and very clever at reading
character and adapting themselves to people.</p>

<p>In a way, too, they had to act as rough and ready
police (for there were no men in brass buttons in the
woods!) and be ready to support the right, and deal out
justice, just as our "cow-boys" of later ranch days had
to prevent horse-stealing.</p>

<p>Now, the tales of their exploits have gone all over the
world, and healthy, active people, and especially young
people, have always delighted in just this sort of life and
character. So, when you add the fact that the word
"scout" has always been used, too, to describe the men
sent out ahead of an army to gain information in the
quickest, cleverest way, it is no wonder that the great
organizations of Boy and Girl Scouts which are spreading
all over the world today should have chosen the name we
are so proud of, to describe the kind of thing they want
to stand for.</p>

<p>Our British Scout-sisters call themselves "Girl Guides,"
and here is the thrilling reason for this title given by the
Chief Scout and Founder of the whole big band that is
spreading round the world today, as so many of Old
England's great ideas have spread.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />WHY "GUIDES"?</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On the North-West Frontier of India there is a famous Corps
of soldiers known as the Guides, and their duty is to be always
ready to turn out at any moment to repel raids by the hostile tribes
across the Border, and to prevent them from coming down into
the peaceful plains of India. This body of men must be prepared
for every kind of fighting. Sometimes on foot, sometimes on horseback,
sometimes in the mountains, often with pioneer work wading
through rivers and making bridges, and so on. But they have to
be a skilful lot of men, brave and enduring, ready to turn out at
any time, winter or summer, or to sacrifice themselves if necessary
in order that peace may reign throughout India while they keep
down any hostile raids against it. So they are true handymen in
every sense of the word, and true patriots.</p>

<p>When people speak of Guides in Europe one naturally thinks
of those men who are mountaineers in Switzerland and other mountainous
places, who can guide people over the most difficult parts
by their own bravery and skill in tackling obstacles, by helpfulness
to those with them, and by their bodily strength of wind and limb.
They are splendid fellows those guides, and yet if they were told
to go across the same amount of miles on an open flat plain it would
be nothing to them, it would not be interesting, and they would
not be able to display those grand qualities which they show directly
the country is a bit broken up into mountains. It is no fun to them
to walk by easy paths, the whole excitement of life is facing difficulties
and dangers and apparent impossibilities, and in the end getting
a chance of attaining the summit of the mountain they have wanted
to reach.</p>

<p>Well, I think it is the case with most girls nowadays. They do
not want to sit down and lead an idle life, not to have everything
done for them, nor to have a very easy time. They don't want
merely to walk across the plain, they would much rather show
themselves handy people, able to help others and ready, if necessary
to sacrifice themselves for others just like the Guides on the North-West
frontier. And they also want to tackle difficult jobs themselves
in their life, to face mountains and difficulties and dangers and to
go at them having prepared themselves to be skilful and brave;
and also they would like to help other people meet their difficulties
also. When they attain success after facing difficulties, then they
feel really happy and triumphant. It is a big satisfaction to them
to have succeeded and to have made other people succeed also.
That is what the Girl Guides want to do, just as the mountaineer
guides do among the mountains.</p>

<p>Then, too, a woman who can do things is looked up to by others,
both men and women, and they are always ready to follow her
advice and example, so there she becomes a Guide too. And later
on if she has children of her own, or if she becomes a teacher of
children, she can be a really good Guide to them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>By means of games and activities which the Guides practise they
are able to learn the different things which will help them to get
on in life, and show the way to others to go on also. Thus camping
and signalling, first aid work, camp cooking, and all these things
that the Guides practise are all going to be helpful to them afterwards
in making them strong, resourceful women, skilful and helpful to
others, and strong in body as well as in mind, and what is more it
makes them a jolly lot of comrades also.</p>

<p>The motto of the Guides on which they work is "Be Prepared,"
that is, be ready for any kind of duty that may be thrust upon
them, and what is more, to know what to do by having practised
it beforehand in the case of any kind of accident or any kind of
work that they may be asked to take up.</p></div>


<div class='center'>MAGDELAINE DE VERCH&Egrave;RES<br /><br />

"THE FIRST GIRL SCOUT"</div>

<p>It is a great piece of luck for us American Scouts that
we can claim the very first Girl Scout for our own great
continent, if not quite for our own United States. A
great Englishman calls her "the first Girl Scout," and
every Scout must feel proud to the core of her heart when
she thinks that this statue which we have selected for
the honor of our frontispiece, standing as it does on British
soil, on the American continent, commemorating a
French girl, the daughter of our Sister Republic, joins
the three great countries closely together, through the
Girl Scouts! Magdelaine de Verch&egrave;res lived in the French
colonies around Quebec late in the seventeenth century.
The colonies were constantly being attacked by the Iroquois
Indians. One of these attacks occurred while Magdelaine's
father, the Seigneur, was away. Magdelaine
rallied her younger brothers about her and succeeded in
holding the fort for eight days, until help arrived from
Montreal.</p>

<p>The documents relating this bit of history have been
in the Archives for many years, but when they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
shown to Lord Grey about twelve years ago he decided
to erect a monument to Magdelaine de Verch&egrave;res on the
St. Lawrence. It was Lord Grey who called Magdelaine
"The First Girl Scout," and as such she will be known.</p>

<p>The following is taken from "A Daughter of New
France," by Arthur G. Doughty who wrote the book for
the Red Cross work of the Magdelaine de Verch&egrave;res
Chapter of the Daughters of the Empire, and dedicated
it to Princess Patricia, whose name was given to the
famous "Princess Pat" regiment.</p>

<p>"On Verch&egrave;res Point, near the site of the Fort, stands a
statue in bronze of the girl who adorned the age in which
she lived and whose memory is dear to posterity. For
she had learned so to live that her hands were clean and
her paths were straight.... To all future visitors to
Canada by way of the St. Lawrence, this silent figure of
the First Girl Scout in the New World conveys a message
of loyalty, of courage and of devotion."</p>

<p>Our own early history is sprinkled thickly with brave,
handy girls, who were certainly Scouts, if ever there were
any, though they never belonged to a patrol, nor recited
the Scout Laws. But they lived the Laws, those strong
young pioneers, and we can stretch out our hands to them
across the long years, and give them the hearty Scout
grip of fellowship, when we read of them.</p>


<h3><br />THE EXPLORER</h3>

<p>If we should ever hold an election for honorary membership
in the Girl Scouts, open to all the girls who ought to
have belonged to us, but who lived too long ago, we should
surely nominate for first place one of the most remarkable
young Indian girls who ever found her way through the
pathless forests,&mdash;Sacajawea, "The Bird Woman."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1806 she was brought to Lewis and Clark on
their expedition into the great Northwest, to act as
interpreter between them and the various Indian tribes
they had to encounter. From the very beginning, when
she induced the hostile Shoshones to act as guides, to the
end of her daring journey, during which, with her papoose
on her back, she led this band of men through hitherto
impassable mountain ranges, till she brought them to
the Pacific Coast, this sixteen-year-old girl never faltered.
No dangers of hunger, thirst, cold or darkness
were too much for her. From the Jefferson to the Yellowstone
River she was the only guide they had; on her
instinct for the right way, her reading of the sun, the
stars and the trees, depended the lives of all of them.
When they fell sick she nursed them; when they lost
heart at the wildness of their venture, she cheered them.
Their party grew smaller and smaller, for Lewis and
Clark had separated early in the expedition, and a part
of Clark's own party fell off when they discovered a
natural route over the Continental Divide where wagons
could not travel. Later, most of those who remained, decided
to go down the Jefferson River in canoes; but Clark
still guided by the plucky Indian girl, persisted in fighting
his way on pony back overland, and after a week of this
journeying, crowded full of discomforts and dangers, she
brought him out in triumph at the Yellowstone, where the
river bursts out from the lower canon,&mdash;and the Great
Northwest was opened up for all time!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The women of Oregon have raised a statue to this
young explorer, and there she stands in Portland, facing
the Coast, pointing to the Columbia River where it reaches
the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>These great virtues of daring and endurance never die
out of the race; though the conditions of our life today,
when most of the exploring has been done, do not demand
them of us in just the form the "Bird Woman"
needed, still, if they die out of the nation, and especially
out of the women of the nation, something has been lost
that no amount of book education can ever replace. Sacajawea,
had no maps to study&mdash;she <i>made</i> maps, and roads
have been built over her footsteps. And so we Scouts,
not to lose this great spirit, study the stars and the sun
and the trees and try to learn a few of the wood secrets
she knew so well. This out-of-door wisdom and self-reliance
was the first great principle of Scouting.</p>


<h3><br />THE HOMEMAKER</h3>

<p>But of course, a country full of "Bird Women" could
not be said to have advanced very far in civilization.
Though we should take great pleasure in conferring her
well-earned merit badges on Sacajawea, we should hardly
have grown into the great organization we are today if
we had not badges for quite another class of achievements.</p>

<p>In 1832, not so many years after the famous Lewis and
Clark expedition, there was born a little New England
girl who would very early in life have become a First
Class Scout if she had had the opportunity. Her name
was Louisa Alcott, and she made that name famous all
the world over by the book by which the world's girls
know her&mdash;"Little Women." Her father, though a brilliant
man, was a very impractical one, and from her first
little story to her last popular book, all her work was
done for the purpose of keeping her mother and sisters,
in comfort. While she was waiting for the money from
her stories she turned carpets, trimmed hats, papered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
rooms, made party dresses for her sisters, nursed anyone
who was sick (at which she was particularly good)&mdash;all
the homely, helpful things that neighbors and families did
for each other in New England towns.</p>

<p>In those days little mothers of families could not telephone
specialists to help them out in emergencies; there
were neither telephones nor specialists! But there were
always emergencies, and the Alcott girls had to know
what to put on a black-and-blue spot, and why the jelly
failed to "jell," and how to hang a skirt, and bake a cake,
and iron a table-cloth. Louisa had to entertain family
guests and darn the family stockings. Her home had not
every comfort and convenience, even as people counted
those things then, and without a brisk, clever woman, full
of what the New Englanders called "faculty," her family
would have been a very unhappy one. With all our
modern inventions nobody has yet invented a substitute
for a good, all-round woman in a family, and until somebody
can invent one, we must continue to take off our
hats to girls like Louisa Alcott. Imagine what her feelings
would have been if someone had told her that she
had earned half a dozen merit badges by her knowledge
of home economics and her clever writing!</p>

<p>And let every Scout who finds housework dull, and
feels that she is capable of bigger things, remember this:
the woman whose books for girls are more widely known
than any such books ever written in America, had to
drop the pen, often and often, for the needle, the dish-cloth
and the broom.</p>

<p>To direct her household has always been a woman's job
in every century, and girls were learning to do it before
Columbus ever discovered Sacajawea's great country. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
be sure, they had no such jolly way of working at it together,
as the Scouts have, nor did they have the opportunity
the girl of today has to learn all about these
things in a scientific, business-like way, in order to get it
all done with the quickest, most efficient methods, just as
any clever business man manages his business.</p>

<p>We no longer believe that housekeeping should take up
all a woman's time; and many an older woman envies the
little badges on a Scout's sleeve that show the world she
has learned how to manage her cleaning and cooking and
household routine so that she has plenty of time to spend
on other things that interest her.</p>


<h3><br />THE PIONEER</h3>

<p>But there was a time in the history of our country when
men and women went out into the wilderness with no
nearer neighbors than the Indians, yet with all the ideals
of the New England they left behind them; girls who
had to have all the endurance of the young "Bird Woman"
and yet keep up the traditions and the habits of
the fine old home life of Louisa Alcott.</p>

<p>One of these pioneer girls, who certainly would have
been patrol leader of her troop and marched them to victory
with her, was Anna Shaw. In 1859, a twelve-year
old girl, with her mother and four other children she traveled
in a rough cart full of bedding and provisions, into
the Michigan woods where they took up a claim, settling
down into a log cabin whose only furniture was a fireplace
of wood and stones.</p>

<p>She and her brothers floored this cabin with lumber
from a mill, and actually made partitions, an attic door
and windows. They planted potatoes and corn by chopping
up the sod, putting seed under it and leaving it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Nature&mdash;who rewarded them by giving them the best
corn and potatoes Dr. Shaw ever ate, she says in her
autobiography.</p>

<p>For she became a preacher and a physician, a lecturer
and organizer, this sturdy little Scout, even though she
had to educate herself, mostly. They papered the cabin
walls with the old magazines, after they had read them
once, and went all over them, in this fashion, later. So
eagerly did she devour the few books sent them from the
East, that when she entered college, years later, she
passed her examinations on what she remembered of
them!</p>

<p>They lived on what they raised from the land; the pigs
they brought in the wagon with them, fish, caught
with wires out of an old hoop skirt, and corn meal brought
from the nearest mill, twenty miles away. Ox teams were
the only means of getting about.</p>

<p>Anna and her brothers made what furniture they used&mdash;bunks,
tables, stools and a settle. She learned to cut
trees and "heart" logs like a man. After a trying season
of carrying all the water used in the household from a
distant creek, which froze in the winter so that they had
to melt the ice, they finally dug a well. First they went
as far as they could with spades, then handed buckets of
earth to each other, standing on a ledge half-way down;
then, when it was deep enough, they lined it with slabs
of wood. It was so well made that the family used it
for twelve years.</p>

<p>Wild beasts prowled around them, Indians terrified
them by sudden visits, the climate was rigorous, amusements
and leisure scanty. But this brave, handy girl met
every job that came to her with a good heart and a smile;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
she learned by doing. The tests and sports for mastering
which we earn badges were life's ordinary problems to her,
and very practical ones. She never knew it, but surely
she was a real Girl Scout!</p>

<p>It is not surprising to learn that she grew up to be
one of the women who earned the American girl her
right to vote. A pioneer in more ways than one, this
little carpenter and farmer and well-digger worked for
the cause of woman's political equality as she had worked
in the Michigan wilderness, and helped on as much as
any one woman, the great revolution in people's ideas
which makes it possible for women today to express their
wishes directly as to how their country shall be governed.
This seems very simple to the girls of today, and will
seem even simpler as the years go on, but, like the Yellowstone
River, it needed its pioneers!</p>

<p>In the Great War through which we have just passed,
the Scouts of all countries gave a magnificent account of
themselves, and honestly earned the "War Service"
badges that will be handed down to future generations,
we may be sure, as the proudest possessions of thousands
of grandchildren whose grandmothers (think of a Scout
grandmother!) were among the first to answer their
Country's call.</p>

<p>Let us hear what our British sisters accomplished, and
we must remember that at the time of the war there were
many Girl Guides well over Scout age and in their twenties,
who had had the advantage, as their book points out,
of years of training.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is what they have done during the Great War.</p>

<p>In the towns they have helped at the Military Hospitals.</p>

<p>In the country they have collected eggs for the sick, and on the
moors have gathered sphagnum moss for the hospitals.</p>

<p>Over in France a great Recreation and Rest Hut for the soldiers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
has been supplied by the Guides with funds earned through their
work. It is managed by Guide officers, or ex-Guides. Among the
older Guides there are many who have done noble work as assistants
to the ward-maids, cooks, and laundry women. In the Government
offices, such as the War Office, the Admiralty, and other great
departments of the State, they have acted as orderlies and messengers.
They have taken up work in factories, or as motor-drivers
or on farms, in order to release men to go to the front.</p>

<p>At home and in their club-rooms they have made bandages for
the wounded, and warm clothing for the men at the Front and in
the Fleet.</p>

<p>At home in many of the great cities the Guides have turned their
Headquarters' Club-Rooms into "Hostels." That is, they have
made them into small hospitals ready for taking in people injured
in air-raids by the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'emeny'">enemy</ins>.</p>

<p>So altogether the Guides have shown themselves to be a pretty
useful lot in many different kinds of work during the war, and,
mind you, they are only girls between the ages of 11 and 18. But
they have done their bit in the Great War as far as they were able,
and have done it well.</p>

<p>There are 100,000 of them, and they are very smart, and ready
for any job that may be demanded of them.</p>

<p>They were not raised for this special work during the war for
they began some years before it, but their motto is "Be Prepared,"
and it was their business to train themselves to be ready for anything
that might happen, even the most unlikely thing.</p>

<p>So even when war came they were "all there" and ready for it.</p>

<p>It is not only in Great Britain that they have been doing this,
but all over our great Empire&mdash;in Canada and Australia, West,
East and South Africa, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, West
Indies, and India. The Guides are a vast sisterhood of girls, ready
to do anything they can for their country and Empire.</p>

<p>Long before there was any idea of the war the Guides had been
taught to think out and to practise what they should do supposing
such a thing as war happened in their own country, or that people
should get injured by bombs or by accidents in their <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'neigborhood'">neighborhood</ins>.
Thousands of women have done splendid work in this war, but
thousands more would have been able to do good work also had
they only Been Prepared for it beforehand by learning a few
things that are useful to them outside their mere school work or
work in their own home. And that is what the Guides are learning
in all their games and camp work: they mean to be useful in other
ways besides what they are taught in school.</p>


<h3><br />WHAT THE GUIDES DO</h3>

<p>As a Guide your first duty is to be helpful to other people, both
in small everyday matters and also under the worst of circumstances.
You have to imagine to yourself what sort of things might possibly
happen, and how you should deal with them when they occur.
Then you will know what to do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>I was present when a German aeroplane dropped a bomb on to
a railway station in London. There was the usual busy scene of
people seeing to their luggage, saying good-bye and going off by
train, when with a sudden bang a whole carriage was blown to bits,
and the adjoining ones were in a blaze; seven or eight of those
active in getting into the train were flung down&mdash;mangled and
dead; while some thirty more were smashed, broken, and bleeding,
but still alive. The suddenness of it made it all the more horrifying.
But one of the first people I noticed as keeping her head was a
smartly dressed young lady kneeling by an injured working-man;
his thigh was smashed and bleeding terribly; she had ripped up his
trousers with her knife, and with strips of it had bound a pad to
the wound; she found a cup somehow and filled it with water for
him from the overhead hose for filling engines. Instead of being
hysterical and useless, she was as cool and ready to do the right
thing as if she had been in bomb-raids every day of her life. Well,
that is what any girl can do if she only prepares herself for it.</p>

<p>These are things which have to be learnt in peace-time, and
because they were learnt by the Guides beforehand, these girls
were able to do their bit so well when war came.</p>


<h3><br />FIRST AID.</h3>

<p>When you see an accident in the street or people injured in an
air raid, the sight of the torn limbs, the blood, the broken bones, and
the sound of the groans and sobbing all make you feel sick and
horrified and anxious to get away from it&mdash;if you're not a Girl
Guide. But that is cowardice: your business as a Guide is to steel
yourself to face it and to help the poor victim. As a matter of fact,
after a trial or two you really get to like such jobs, because with
coolheadedness and knowledge of what to do you feel you give the
much-needed help.</p>

<p><i>The Value of Nursing.</i>&mdash;In this war hundreds and hundreds of
women have gone to act as nurses in the hospitals for the wounded
and have done splendid work. They will no doubt be thankful
all their lives that while they were yet girls they learnt how to
nurse and how to do hospital work, so that they were useful when
the call came for them. But there are thousands and thousands
of others who wanted to do the work when the time came, but they
had not like Guides, Been Prepared, and they had never learnt how
to nurse, and so they were perfectly useless and their services were
not required in the different hospitals. So carry out your motto
and Be Prepared and learn all you can about hospital and child
nursing, sick nursing, and every kind, while you are yet a Guide
and have people ready to instruct you and to help you in learning.</p></div>

<p>In countries not so settled and protected as England
and America, where the women and girls are taught to
count upon their men to protect them in the field, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Girl <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Souts'">Scouts</ins> have sometimes had to display a courage like
that of the early settlers. A Roumanian Scout, Ecaterina
Teodorroiu actually fought in the war and was taken
prisoner. She escaped, traced her way back to her company,
and brought valuable information as to the enemy's
movements. For these services she was decorated "as a
reward for devotion and conspicuous bravery" with the
Order of Merit and a special gold medal of the Scouts,
only given for services during the war. At the same
time she was promoted to the rank of Honorary
Second Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Can we wonder that she is known as the Joan of Arc
of Roumania?</p>

<p>During the Russian Revolution the Girl Scouts were
used by the Government in many practical ways, as may
be seen from the following letter from one of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Scouts assisted from the beginning, from seven
in the morning until twelve at night, carrying messages,
sometimes containing state secrets, letters, etc., from
the Duma to the different branches of it called commissariats,
and back again. They also fed the soldiers
that were on guard. The Scout uniform was our protection,
and everywhere that uniform commanded the
respect of the soldiers, peasants and workingmen.</p>

<p>"As great numbers of soldiers came from the front,
food had to be given them. It was contributed by private
people, but the Scouts had lots of work distributing
it. All the little taverns were turned into
eating houses for the soldiers, and there we helped to
prepare the food and feed them. As there were not
enough Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts helped in the same
way as the boys.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Scouts also did much First Aid work. In one
instance I saw an officer whose finger had been shot
off. I ran up to him and bandaged it up for him. (All
of us Scouts had First Aid kits hanging from our
belts.)</p>

<p>"It was something of a proud day for us Scouts
when the Premier after a parade, called us all before
the Duma and publicly thanked us for our aid."</p></div>

<p>Indeed it was and we heartily congratulate our Sister
Scouts! But if we do our duty by our Patrol and the
Patrols all do their duty by their Troop, that proud moment
is going to come to every single Scout of us, when
the town <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wherewe'">where we</ins> live tells us by its smiles and applause,
when we go by in uniform, what it thinks of us.</p>

<p>We Scouts shall be more and more interested, as the
years go on, to remember that in the great hours of one
of the world's greatest crises we helped to make its
history. Instances like these are very exceptional;
they could not occur to one in ten thousand of us; but
we stay-at-homes can always remind ourselves that it was
the obedience, the quickness, and the skill learned in quiet,
every-day Scouting that made these few rise to their
opportunity when it came.</p>

<p>War and revolution do not make Scouts either brave
or useful; they only bring out the bravery and the usefulness
that have been learned, as we are all learning them,
every day!</p>

<p>All we have to do is to fix Scout habits in our hearts
and hands, and then when our Country calls us, we shall
be as ready as these little Russian Scouts were.</p>

<p>In France the Scouts, known as the Eclaireuses, have
agreed with us that the "land Army" is the best army
for women. Rain or shine, in heat and cold, they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
dug and ploughed and planted, and learned the lesson
American girls learned long ago&mdash;that team work is what
counts!</p>

<p>A bit of one of their reports is translated here:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The crops were fine&mdash;potatoes, radishes, greens and
beans were raised. The crop of potatoes, especially,
was so good that the Eclaireuses were able to supply
their families with them at a price defying competition,
and they always had enough besides for their
own use on excursions. (Our hikes.)</p>

<p>"Such has been the reward of the care, given so
perseveringly and intelligently to the gardening.</p>

<p>"And what an admirable lesson! Not a minute was
lost in this out-of-door work; chests and muscles filled
out; and at the same time the girls learned to recognize
weather signs; rain or sun were the factors which
determined the success or non-success of the planting.
And each day, there grew in them also love and gratitude
for the earth and its elements, without the assistance
of which we could harvest nothing.</p>

<p>"Is this not the best method of preparing our youth
to return to the land, to the healthy and safe life of
the beautiful countryside of France; by showing them
the interest and usefulness that lie in agricultural
labor?</p>

<p>"So the Eclaireuse becomes a model of the new
women, used to sport, possessing her First Aid
Diploma, able to cook good simple meals, marching
under orders, knowing how to obey, ready to accept
her responsibility, good-natured and lively in rain or
sun, in public or in her home.... They continue
their courses in sewing, hygiene and gymnastics and
assist eagerly at conferences arranged for them to discuss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the duties of the Eclaireuses and what it is necessary
to do to become a good Captain.</p>

<p>"To make themselves useful&mdash;that is the ideal of
the Eclaireuses. They know that in order to do this
it is becoming more and more necessary to acquire a
broad and complete knowledge."</p></div>

<p>It is quite a feather in the cap of this great Scout
Family of ours that we are teaching the French girl,
who has not been accustomed to leave her home or to
work in clubs or troops, what a jolly, wonder-working
thing a crowd of girls, all forging ahead together, can
be.</p>

<p>In our own country we were protected from the worst
sides of the great war, but we had a wonderful opportunity
to show how we could Be Prepared ourselves by
seeing that our brave soldiers were prepared.</p>

<p>Our War Records show an immense amount of Red
Cross supplies, knitting, comfort kits, food grown and
conserved in every way, money raised for Liberty Loans
and Thrift Stamps, war orphans adopted, home replacement
work undertaken and carried through; all these
to so great an amount that the country recognized
our existence and services as never before in our history,
the Government, indeed, employing sixty uniformed
Scouts as messengers in the Surgeon General's Department.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is only the truth to say that the war showed
our country what we could Be Prepared to do for her!
And it showed us, too.</p>

<p>It has been said that women can never be the same
after the great events of the last few years, and we must
never forget that the Girl Scouts of today are the women
of tomorrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<h2>SECTION V</h2>

<h3>THE OUT-OF-DOOR SCOUT</h3>

<p>Busy as the Girl Scout may be with learning to do in
a clever, up-to-date way all the things to improve her
home and town that the old pioneer girls knew how to
do, she never forgets that the original Scouts were out-of-door
people. So long as there are bandages to make
or babies to bathe or meals to get or clothes to make,
she does them all, quickly and cheerfully, and is very
rightly proud of the badges she gets for having learned
to do them all, and the sense of independence that comes
from all this skill with her hands. It gives her a real
glow of pleasure to feel that because of her First Aid
practice she may be able to save a life some day, and
that the hours of study she put in at her home nursing
and invalid cooking may make her a valuable asset to the
community in case of any great disaster or epidemic;
but the real fun of scouting lies in the great life of out-of-doors,
and the call of the woods is answered quicker
by the Scout than by anybody, because the Scout learns
just how to get the most out of all this wild, free life and
how to enjoy it with the least trouble and the most fun.</p>

<p>One of our most experienced and best loved Captains
says that "a camp is as much a necessity for the Girl
Scouts as an office headquarters," and more and more
girls are learning to agree with her every year.</p>

<p>Our British <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'counsins'">cousins</ins> are the greatest lovers of out-of-door
life in the world, and it is only natural that we
should look to our Chief Scout to hear what he has to
say to his Girl Guides on this subject so dear to his heart
that he founded Scouting, that all boys and girls might
share his enthusiastic pleasure in going back to Nature
to study and to love her and to gain happiness and health
from her woods and fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />HOW CAMPING TEACHES THE GUIDE LAW</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Last year a man went out into the woods in America to try and
see if he could live like the prehistoric men used to do; that is to
say, he took nothing with him in the way of food or equipment or
even clothing&mdash;he went just as he was, and started out to make
his own living as best he could. Of course the first thing he had to
do was to make some sort of tool or weapon by which he could
kill some animals, cut his wood and make his fire and so on. So
he made a stone axe, and with that was able to cut out branches
of trees so that he could make a trap in which he eventually caught
a bear and killed it. He then cut up the bear and used the skin
for blankets and the flesh for food. He also cut sticks and made a
little instrument by which he was able to ignite bits of wood and so
start his fire. He also searched out various roots and berries and
leaves, which he was able to cook and make into good food, and he
even went so far as to make charcoal and to cut slips of bark from
the trees and draw pictures of the scenery and animals around him.
In this way he lived for over a month in the wild, and came out in
the end very much better in health and spirits and with a great
experience of life. For he had learned to shift entirely for himself
and to be independent of the different things we get in civilization
to keep us going in comfort.</p>

<p>That is why we go into camp a good deal in the Boy Scout and
in the Girl Guide movement, because in camp life we learn to do
without so many things which while we are in houses we think are
necessary, and find that we can do for ourselves many things where
we used to think ourselves helpless. And before going into camp
it is just as well to learn some of the things that will be most useful
to you when you get there. And that is what we teach in the Headquarters
of the Girl Guide Companies before they go out and take
the field. For instance, you must know how to light your own fire;
how to collect dry enough wood to make it burn; because you will
not find gas stoves out in the wild. Then you have to learn how to
find your own water, and good water that will not make you ill.
You have not a whole cooking range or a kitchen full of cooking
pots, and so you have to learn to cook your food in the simplest
way with the means at your hand, such as a simple cooking pot or
a roasting stick or an oven made with your own hands out of an
old tin box or something of that kind.</p></div>


<h3><br />NATURE STUDY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is only while in camp that one can really learn to study Nature
in the proper way and not as you merely do it inside the school;
because here you are face to face with Nature at all hours of the
day and night. For the first time you live under the stars and can
watch them by the hour and see what they really look like, and
realize what an enormous expanse of almost endless space they cover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
You know from your lessons at school that our sun warms and lights
up a large number of different worlds like ours, all circling round it
in the Heavens. And when you hold up a shilling at arm's length
and look at the sky, the shilling covers no less than two hundred of
those suns, each with their different little worlds circling around
them. And you then begin to realize what an enormous endless
space the Heavens comprise. You realize perhaps for the first
time the enormous work of God.</p>

<p>Then also in camp you are living among plants of every kind,
and you can study them in their natural state, how they grow and
what they look like, instead of merely seeing pictures of them in
books or dried specimens of them in collections.</p>

<p>All round you, too, are the birds and animals and insects, and
the more you know of them the more you begin to like them and to
take an interest in them; and once you take an interest in them you
do not want to hurt them in any way. You would not rob a bird's
nest; you would not bully an animal; you would not kill an insect&mdash;once
you have realized what its life and habits are. In this way,
therefore, you fulfill the Guide Law of becoming a friend to animals.</p>

<p>By living in camp you begin to find that though there are many
discomforts and difficulties to be got over, they can be got over with
a little trouble and especially if you smile at them and tackle them.</p>

<p>Then living among other comrades in camp you have to be helpful
and do good turns at almost every minute, and you have to exercise
a great deal of give and take and good temper, otherwise the camp
would become unbearable.</p>

<p>So you carry out the different laws of courteousness, of helpfulness,
and friendliness to others that come in the Guide Law. Also
you pick up the idea of how necessary it is to keep everything in
its place, and to keep your kit and tent and ground as clean as
possible; otherwise you get into a horrible state of dirt, and dirt
brings flies and other inconveniences.</p>

<p>You save every particle of food and in this way you learn not
only cleanliness, but thrift and economy. And you very soon realize
how cheaply you can live in camp, and how very much enjoyment
you can get for very little money. And as you live in the fresh,
pure air of God you find that your own thoughts are clean and pure
as the air around you. There is hardly one of the Guide Laws that
is not better carried out after you have been living and practising
it in camp.</p>

<p><i>Habits of Animals.</i>&mdash;If you live in the country it is of course
quite easy to observe and watch the habits of all sorts of animals
great and small. But if you are in a town there are many difficulties
to be met with. But at the same time if you can keep pets of any
kind, rabbits, rats, mice, dogs or ponies you can observe and watch
their habits and learn to understand them well; but generally for
Guides it is more easy to watch birds, because you see them both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in town and country; and especially when you go into camp or on
walking tours you can observe and watch their habits, especially in
the springtime.</p>

<p>Then it is that you see the old birds making their nests, hatching
out their eggs and bringing up their young; and that is of course
the most interesting time for watching them. A good observant
guide will get to know the different kinds of birds by their cry, by
their appearance, and by their way of flying. She will also get to
know where their nests are to be found, what sort of nests they are,
what are the colors of the eggs and so on. And also how the
young appear. Some of them come out fluffy, others covered with
feathers, others with very little on at all. The young pigeon, for
instance, has no feathers at all, whereas a young moorhen can swim
about as soon as it comes out of the egg; while chickens run about
and hunt flies within a few minutes; and yet a sparrow is quite
useless for some days and is blind, and has to be fed and coddled by
his parents.</p>

<p>Then it is an interesting sight to see the old birds training their
young ones to fly, by getting up above them and flapping their wings
a few times until all the young ones imitate them. Then they hop
from one twig to another, still flapping their wings, and the young
ones follow suit and begin to find that their wings help them to
balance; and finally they jump from one branch to another for some
distance so that the wings support them in their effort. The young
ones very soon find that they are able to use their wings for flying,
but it is all done by degrees and by careful instruction.</p>

<p>Then a large number of our birds do not live all the year round
in England, but they go off to Southern climes such as Africa when
the winter comes on; but they generally turn up here at the end of
March and make their nest during the spring. Nightingales arrive
early in April; wagtails, turtle doves, and cuckoos come late in
April; woodcock come in the autumn, and redpoles and fieldfares
also come here for the winter. In September you will see the migrating
birds collecting to go away, the starlings in their crowds and
the swallows for the South, and so do the warblers, the flycatchers,
and the swifts. And yet about the same time the larks are arriving
here from the Eastward, so there is a good deal of traveling among
the birds in the air at all times of the year.</p></div>

<p>How many of our American Scouts are able to supply
from their observation all of our native birds to take
the places of these mentioned in this lovely paragraph?
Everyone should be able to.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Nature in the City.</i>&mdash;This noticing of small things, especially in
animal life, not only gives you great interest, but it also gives you
great fun and enjoyment in life. Even if you live in a city you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
can do a certain amount of observation of birds and animals. You
would think there is not much fun to be got out of it in a murky
town like London or Sheffield, and yet if you begin to notice and
know all about the sparrows you begin to find there is a great deal
of character and amusement to be got out of them, by watching
their ways and habits, their nesting, and their way of teaching their
young ones to fly.</p></div>


<h3><br />OBSERVATION.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Stalking.</i>&mdash;A Guide has to be sharp at seeing things if she is
going to be any good as a Guide. She has to notice every little
track and every little sign, and it is this studying of tracks and
following them out and finding out their meaning which we include
under the name of stalking. For instance, if you want to find a
bird's-nest you have to stalk. That is to say, you watch a bird
flying into a bush and guess where its nest is, and follow it up and
find the nest. With some birds it is a most difficult thing to find
their nests; take, for instance, the skylark or the snipe. But those
who know the birds, especially the snipe, will recognize their call.
The snipe when she is alarmed gives quite a different call from when
she is happy and flying about. She has a particular call when she
has young ones about. So that those who have watched and listened
and know her call when they hear it know pretty well where the
young ones are or where the nest is and so on.</p>

<p>"<i>How to Hide Yourself.</i>&mdash;When you want to observe wild animals
you have to stalk them, that is, creep up to them without their
seeing or smelling you.</p>

<p>"A hunter when he is stalking wild animals keeps himself entirely
hidden, so does the war scout when watching or looking for the
enemy; a policemen does not catch pickpockets by standing about
in uniform watching for them; he dresses like one of the crowd, and
as often as not gazes into a shop window and sees all that goes on
behind him reflected as if in a looking-glass.</p>

<p>"If a guilty person finds himself being watched, it puts him on
his guard, while an innocent person becomes annoyed. So, when
you are observing people, don't do so by openly staring at them,
but notice the details you want to at one glance or two, and if you
want to study them more, walk behind them; you can learn just
as much from a back view, in fact more than you can from a front
view, and, unless they are scouts and look around frequently, they
do not know that you are observing them.</p>

<p>"War scouts and hunters stalking game always carry out two
important things when they don't want to be seen."</p>

<p>One is <i>Background</i>.&mdash;They <i>take care that the ground behind them,
or trees, or buildings, etc., are of the same colour as their clothes</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>And the other is "<i>Freezing</i>".&mdash;If an enemy or a deer is seen looking for
them, <i>they remain perfectly still without moving so long as he is there</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tracking.</i>&mdash;The native hunters in most wild countries follow their
game by watching for tracks on the ground, and they become so
expert at seeing the slightest sign of a footmark on the ground that
they can follow up their prey when an ordinary civilized man can
see no sign whatever. But the great reason for looking for signs
and tracks is that from these you can read a meaning. It is exactly
like reading a book. You will see the different letters, each letter
combining to make a word, and the words then make sense; and there
are also commas and full-stops and colons; all of these alter the
meaning of the sense. These are all little signs, which one who is
practised and has learnt reading, makes into sense at once, whereas
a savage who has never learned could make no sense of it at all.
And so it is with tracking.</p></div>


<h3><br />TRACKING.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Sign" is the word used by Guides to mean any little details,
such as footprints, broken twigs, trampled grass, scraps of food,
old matches, etc.</p>

<p>Some native Indian trackers were following up the footprints of
a panther that had killed and carried off a young kid. He had
crossed a wide bare slab which, of rock, of course, gave no mark
of his soft feet. The tracker went at once to the far side of the
rock where it came to a sharp edge; he wetted his finger, and just
passed it along the edge till he found a few kid's hairs sticking to
it. This showed him where the panther had passed down off the
rock, dragging the kid with him. Those few hairs were what Guides
call "signs."</p>

<p>This tracker also found bears by noticing small "signs." On one
occasion he noticed a fresh scratch in the bark of a tree, evidently
made by a bear's claw, and on the other he found a single black hair
sticking to the bark of a tree, which told him that a bear had rubbed
against it.</p>

<p><i>Details in the Country.</i>&mdash;If you are in the country, you should
notice landmarks&mdash;that is, objects which help you to find your way
to prevent your getting lost&mdash;such as distant hills and church towers;
and nearer objects, such as peculiar buildings, trees, gates, rocks, etc.</p>

<p>And remember in noticing such landmarks that you may want
to use your knowledge of them some day for telling some one else
how to find his way, so you must notice them pretty closely so as
to be able to describe them unmistakably and in their proper order.
You must notice and remember every by-road and foot-path.</p>

<p>Remembrance of these things will help you to find your way by
night or in fog when other people are losing themselves.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the tracks of two birds on the ground. One that
lives generally on the ground, the other in bushes and
trees. Which track belongs to which bird?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Using your Eyes.</i>&mdash;Let nothing be too small for your notice&mdash;a
button, a match, a hair, a cigar ash, a feather, or a leaf might
be of great importance, even a fingerprint which is almost invisible
to the naked eye has often been the means of detecting a crime.</p>

<p>With a little practice in observation you can tell pretty accurately
a man's character from his dress.</p>

<p>How would you recognize that a gentleman was fond of fishing.
If you see his left cuff with little tufts of cloth sticking up, you may
be sure he fishes. When he takes his flies off the line he will either
stick them into his cap to dry, or hook them into his sleeve. When
dry he pulls them out, which often tears a thread or two of the
cloth.</p>

<p>Remember how "Sherlock Holmes" met a stranger, and noticed
that he was looking fairly well-to-do, in new clothes with a mourning
band on his sleeve, with a soldiery bearing and a sailor's way of
walking, sunburns, with tattoo marks on his hands, and he was
carrying some children's toys in his hands. What would you have
supposed that man to be. Well, Sherlock Holmes guessed correctly
that he had lately retired from the Royal Marines as a sergeant,
that his wife had died, and that he had some small children at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Practice in Observation.</span>&mdash;<i>Instructor can take the fingermarks
of each girl. Lightly rub the thumb on blacklead or on paper that
is blacked with pencil, then press the thumb on paper and examine
with magnifying glass. Show that no two persons' prints are alike.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In Town.</span>&mdash;<i>Practice your girls first in walking down a street to
notice the different kinds of shops as they pass, and to remember them
in their proper sequence at the end.</i><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Then to notice and remember the names on the shops.</i><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Then to notice and remember the contents of a shop window after
two minutes' gaze. Finally, to notice the contents of several shop
windows in succession with half a minute at each. Give marks for the
fullest list.</i><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Guides must also notice prominent buildings as landmarks, and
the number of turnings off the street they are using.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In the Country.</span>&mdash;<i>Take the patrol out for a walk and teach the
girls to notice distant prominent features, such as hills, church steeples,
and so on; and as nearer landmarks such things as peculiar buildings,
trees, rocks, gates, by-roads or paths, nature of fences, crops different
kinds of trees, birds, animals, tracks, people, vehicles, etc. Also any
peculiar smells of plants, animals, manure, etc.; whether gates or doors
were open or shut, whether any smoke from chimneys, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>Send Guides out in pairs.</i></p>

<p><i>It adds to the value of the practice if the instructor makes a certain
number of small marks in the ground beforehand, or leaves buttons or</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<i>matches, etc., for the girls to notice or to pick up and bring in as a means
of making them examine the ground close to them as well as distant
objects.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Practices in Natural History.</span>&mdash;<i>Take out Guides to get specimens
of leaves, fruit, or blossoms of various trees, shrubs, etc., and observe
the shape and nature of the tree both in summer and in winter.</i></p>

<p><i>Collect leaves of different trees; let Guides make tracings of them and
write the name of the tree on each.</i></p>

<p><i>In the country make Guides examine crops in all stages of their
growth, so that they know pretty well by sight what kind of crop is coming
up.</i></p>

<p><i>Start gardens if possible, either a patrol garden or individual Guides'
gardens. Let them grow flowers and vegetables for profit to pay for
their equipment, etc. Show all the wild plants which may be made use
of for food. Find yew trees; report if any good branches to make archers'
bows of.</i></p>

<p><i>Encourage the keeping of live pets, whether birds, animals, reptiles,
insects. Show how to keep illustrated diary-records of plants, insects,
birds, etc., giving dates when seen for comparison following year and
showing their peculiar markings, etc.</i></p>

<p><i>If in a town take your Guides to the Zoological Gardens, menagerie
or Natural History Museum, and show them particular animals on
which you are prepared to lecture. Not more than half a dozen for
one visit.</i></p>

<p><i>If in the country get farmers or shepherd to help with information
on the habits of farm animals, e. g., how a cow lies down and when.
How to milk, stalk rabbits, water voles, trout, birds, etc., and watch
their habits.</i></p></div>

<h2>SECTION VI</h2>

<h2>FORMS FOR SCOUT CEREMONIES</h2>


<h3><br />1. ENROLLMENT</h3>

<p>Before a girl may become enrolled as a regular Girl
Scout she must be at least ten years old, and must have
attended the meetings of a Troop for at least a month,
during which time she must have passed her Tenderfoot
Test. The Captain must have prepared the candidate
for enrollment by explaining the meaning of the Promise
and the Laws and making sure that she fully understands
the meaning of the oath she is about to make, and
that she also comprehends the meaning of "honor." The
following is a convenient form for enrollments.</p>

<div class="hang1">(1) The Scouts stand in the form of a horseshoe with the
officer who is to enroll at the open side, facing Scouts.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(2) Officer addresses troops on the subject of what it
means to be a Scout.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(3) Patrol Leader brings candidate to officer and salutes
and returns to place.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(4) Officer addresses candidate in low tone: "What
does your honor mean?"<br />

Candidate answers.<br />

Officer: "Will you on your honor, try: To do your
duty to God and to your Country; to help other
people at all times; to obey the Scout Laws?"<br />

Candidate and officer both salute as candidate repeats
Promise. Officer: "I trust you on your
honor to keep this Promise."</div>

<div class='hang1'>(5) Officer pins Tenderfoot Badge on the new scout,
explaining what it stands for, that it symbolizes
her Scout life, and so forth.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(6) Scout and officer salute each other. Scout turns
and troop salutes her, scout returning salute, and
then goes alone to her place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang1'>(7) All Scouts present repeat Promise and Laws. Troop
then breaks ranks to take up some Scout activity.</div>

<p>When many scouts are to be enrolled, four at a time
may be presented to the officer, but each should singly
be asked and should answer the question: "What does
your honor mean?" All four repeat the Promise together
and the officer addresses all together in saying: "I trust
you on your honor to keep this Promise," but speaks
to each separately as she puts on the pin.</p>

<p>A Captain may perform this ceremony or she may ask
some higher Scout officer to do so.</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. <i>Presentation of Other Badges</i></div>

<p>The following form of ceremony was devised for
special use in the presentation of the highest honor attainable
by a Girl Scout, the Golden Eaglet, but the same
outline may be followed for giving Merit Badges, and First
and Second Class Badges, or any other medals or honors.</p>

<p><i>Presentation of Golden Eaglet.</i>&mdash;As the presentation of
the Golden Eaglet is an important occasion in the life of
a Scout and her Troop, it should take place at a public
Scout function, such as a District or Community Rally,
a reception to a distinguished guest of the Scouts, or possibly
at the time of a civic celebration.</p>

<p>The Court of Awards is responsible for all details of
the meeting, and it is suggested that it invite parents,
friends and other persons interested in the Scout movement
to be present. The medal may be presented by the
Chairman of the Court of Awards, some other member of
that Committee or by a higher Scout officer.</p>

<p>Arrangements for the ceremony should be planned so
that during the presentation of guests, the Court of
Awards, the Eaglet's troop and the Color Guard form a
hollow square, with the Captain at her post three paces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in front of the Troop, the Lieutenant at her post "center
and rear" of the Troop. The ceremony should be rehearsed
wherever possible, so that all action and form
shall be as smart as possible.</p>

<p>1. The Court of Awards enters and takes its place
at right angles to the assembled guests.</p>

<p>2. The Captain enters, takes post, and gives all commands.</p>

<p>3. The Color Guard (bearer of the American flag,
bearer of the Troop flag, and two guards) followed by
Troop to which the Eaglet belongs, enter and march two
paces in front of the Court of Awards. The lieutenant is
at the left of the leading file. The Troop marches in
single file, by twos or in Squad formation according to
the number, and the space available.</p>

<p>When the Troop is very large, or the space restricted,
the Eaglet's Patrol may take the place of the Troop. As
the Colors pass, the Court of Awards should rise, stand
at attention, and if Scouts, salute.</p>

<p>4. When the Color Guard at the head of the column
has passed the Court of Awards, the command "Column
left, MARCH!" is given. When the last file has completed
the movement, the following commands are given:</p>

<div class='hang1'>(1) "Scouts, HALT!"</div>

<div class='hang1'>(2) "Left, FACE," or<br />

"Squads, left, MARCH, Squads, HALT," according
to the formation of the column.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(3) "Right, DRESS, FRONT!"</div>

<p>5. At the command "Left, FACE," or "Squads, left,
MARCH, Squads HALT," the Color Guard makes a left
turn, marches forward until on a line with the Court of
Awards, again makes a left turn, immediately halts and
grounds flags.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>6. When the Troop and Color Guard are in position,
the Captain gives the command "Patrol Leader and
Eaglet, forward, MARCH!" The Patrol Leader escorts
the Eaglet to the Captain, salutes the Captain and returns
to her position in line.</p>

<p>7. The Chairman of the Court of Awards comes forward,
the Captain faces her, salutes, and presents the
Eaglet to her.</p>

<p>8. The Chairman after reading the list of Merit
Badges which the Scout has earned in order to receive
the Golden Eaglet, pins the medal on to the Eaglet's blouse,
over the middle of the right pocket. The Eaglet salutes.</p>

<p>If desired this is the opportunity for the Official presenting
the badge to say a few words.</p>

<p>9. After the presentation, the Eaglet turns, and facing
her Captain and Troop, stands at attention as the
Colors are raised, the Scout flag dipped, and the Troop
salutes. The Eaglet returns the salute and then marches
to her position in line.</p>

<p>10. The Captain gives the command "Color Guard
forward, MARCH." The Color Guard marches in front
of the Captain and Troop who salute as the Colors pass,
make a right turn two paces in front of the Court of
Honor and march out.</p>

<p>11. After the Colors have left the "square" the Lieutenant
takes her position at the left of the leading file.</p>

<p>The Captain gives the commands:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"Right, FACE, MARCH!" or "Squads right,
MARCH!"<br />

"Column left, MARCH!"</div>

<div class='unindent'>and the Troop marches out. The Captain turns, salutes
the Court of Awards and passes out.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Where there is no Local Council or Court of Awards,
Captains are asked to communicate with the National
Headquarters concerning the ceremony of presentation
of the Golden Eaglet.</p>


<h3><br />ALTERNATE FORMS FOR SCOUT
CEREMONIES</h3>

<p>In the case of troops for which this formal procedure
is not practical, and for the better assistance of Captains
and Councils who feel the need of a more definite formulation
of the Scout principles on these occasions, the following
ceremonies are suggested. They are designed
to meet the necessity for expressing at each stage of the
Scout's progress, recognition of her achievement up to
that point and appreciation of her future responsibilities.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>1. Tenderfoot Enrollment</b></div>

<p>1. The Troop being assembled in any desired formation,
the Captain calls forward those who have passed
the test.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="hang1">Captain: "Scout &mdash;&mdash;, do you think you know what
it means to be loyal to God and your Country, to
help other people at all times, and to obey the
Scout Laws?"</div>

<div class='hang1'>Scout: "I think I do, and I will try my best not
to fail in any of them."</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>This is repeated to each Tenderfoot.</i></div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain: "Are you ready to make your Promise
with your Troop?"</div>

<div class='hang1'>New Scouts (<i>together</i>): "Yes."</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain: "Scouts of Troop &mdash;&mdash;, repeat your
promise."</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>All salute and repeat the Promise.</i></div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain: "I trust you on your honor to keep this
Promise."<br />

(<i>Here, when practicable, investiture of hat, neckerchief,
etc., takes place.</i>)<br />

<i>Captain then pins on Tenderfoot pin While
attaching it, she says:</i></div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain: "This pin makes you a Girl Scout. It
is yours, so long as you are worthy of it."<br />

<i>Captain dismisses recently enrolled Scouts to their
Troop position.</i><br />

(<i>Here the Captain may add, if she wishes, anything

<div class="hang1">Captain: "Scout &mdash;&mdash;, you have learned what is
necessary for a Second Class Scout to know.
Do you think you can apply your knowledge, if

training you have gone through have made you
more capable of doing your duty to God and to
your Country, of helping other people at all times
and of obeying the Scout Laws, than you were as
a Tenderfoot?"</div>

<div class='hang1'>Scouts (<i>together</i>): "Yes."</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain (<i>pinning on each badge, and speaking to

<div class='hang1'>Official (<i>to each Scout separately, the Captain giving

the final Scout test. You should thoroughly understand
by now the meaning of duty to God and
Country, the privilege of helpfulness to others,

<div class='hang1'>Scout: "I am. And I realize that I must help
other Scouts to see these things as I see them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang1'>Official: "Scouts &mdash;&mdash; (<i>reading the candidates'

won the right to wear these badges we are about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to present to you, and we are glad to do so. We
take this <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'oportunity'">opportunity</ins> of reminding you, however,
that all good Scouts understand that they are far
from having completely mastered the subjects represented
by these badges. The symbols which
you wear on your sleeve mean that you have an
intelligent interest in the subjects you have chosen,
understand the principles of them, and can give
reasonable, practical proof of this. Do you realize
that the Girl Scout Organization credits you with
a good foundation and trusts to you to continue
to build upon it intelligently?"</div>

<div class='hang1'>Scouts (<i>together</i>): "Yes."</div>

<div class='hang1'>Official (<i>pinning on badges and speaking to each

<div class='center'><br /><b>5. Golden Eaglet Ceremony</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>Official: "What badges does Scout &mdash;&mdash; offer?"</div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Captain reads the list Badges earned by the Candidate.</i></div>

<div class='hang1'>Official: "Troop &mdash;&mdash;, do you agree that Scout &mdash;&mdash; has

<div class='hang1'>Official: "Scout &mdash;&mdash;, you have won the highest
honor in the gift of the Girl Scouts."<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Scout life meant nothing more to you
than a reasonable understanding of certain subjects,
there would now be nothing more for the
Girl Scouts to teach you; but I am sure that your
training has not failed in this respect, and that
you understand now, even better than the average
Girl Scout, that your great principles of duty to
God and Country, helpfulness to others, and obedience
to the Scout Laws, are lessons that no Scout
can fully learn as long as she lives. Do you agree
to this?"</div>

<div class='hang1'>Golden Eaglet: "I agree to it thoroughly."</div>

your fine achievement."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><br />

<i>Scout salutes or shakes the hand of the Official, as
desired, and returns to her troop position.</i><br />

<i>(Here the Official may address the audience at discretion).</i></div>

<p>The accompanying diagram of suggested relative positions
in Scout ceremonies lends itself equally to a small
room, theatre, hall or open field. Whether the Scouts
form a troop or even one patrol; whether they make use
of strict military formation or informal grouping; whether
the visiting Scout dignitaries are many or limited to one
member of the local Council, the Scout bodies face each
other, and the guest or guests of honor, equally with the
general audience, can observe the Troop and the candidates
easily from the side.</p>

<p>All Troops who are familiar with military drill can take
their usual positions in their usual manner and observe
all details of color guard, salutes, etc., to any desired extent.
Troops and Captains not familiar with such procedure,
by accustoming themselves to this general grouping,
will always be able to present a dignified appearance.</p>

<p>Note: These suggestions for the various ceremonials
assume that the regular opening of the Scout meetings has
already taken place; therefore nothing is given but the
actual matter of the presentations, etc. In the case of
the Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class awards, the
ceremonies constitute the special business of the meeting,
and opening and closing should proceed as usual. They
are distinctly Scout business and are not, in general, offered
to the public.</p>

<p>The awarding of Merit Badges might with advantage
be connected with any local civic ceremony where interest
in young people may be created; and in the case of the
Golden Eaglet award it is distinctly desirable thus to connect
it. Any visiting dignitary, national or state, may with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
propriety be asked to officiate; and where different organizations
are taking their various parts in a public function,
it will not always be possible to claim the time nor
the space for the regular Scout opening ceremonies, nor
would this necessarily be advisable. It is, therefore, well
to be provided with a form like the preceding, where a
small delegation from the Troop, the Captain and a Councillor
could, if necessary, represent the essential units of<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">the organization among a number of other societies; and</span><br />
the words of the ceremony would explain the occasion
sufficiently without much concerted action, and may be
inserted at the proper place, preceded and followed by any
Troop or local customs preferred.</p>

</table></div>

<p>3. "Right Dress," "Front."</p>

<p>4. Inspection. Captain inspects for posture, and for personal
appearance which should be neat and clean in every
particular, and uniform, which should be correct as to style,
length, placing of insignia, etc. All necessary corrections
should be made in a low tone of voice to the individual Scout.</p>

<p>5. "Color Bearer, Forward&mdash;Center" "March." The Color
Bearer, appointed to carry flag, upon receiving order to
"March", takes one step backward, executes "Right Face,"
marches out of rank, executes "Left Face," marches to point
on line with flag, executes "Right Face," marches to within
two steps of flag and comes to "Halt." She salutes flag, takes
staff in both hands, wheels right, and marches to position
three paces in front of, and facing troop. The captain and
Lieutenant have moved to position at right angles to, and at
right of troop. If a color Guard is used instead of Color
Bearer, two Scouts act as guards, their position being on
either side of bearer. They leave ranks together, form in
line at right of troop, march shoulder to shoulder and always
wheel to the right, the Color Bearer being the pivot and
giving all orders to Guard. After Bearer has taken flag and
turns, the Guards salute, take one step forward, about-face,
and all march to position in front of troop. The Color
Guard never takes part in the repeating of the Promise, Laws,
Pledge of Allegiance or singing of Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p>6. "Scouts, the flag of your country, Pledge Allegiance."
The Pledge of Allegiance should be followed by one verse of
the Star Spangled Banner.</p>

<p>7. "The Scout Promise," "Salute."</p>

<p>8. "The Scout Laws, Repeat."</p>

<p>9. "Color Bearer, Post-March." The Color Bearer, turning
always to right, returns flag to its post, places it in position,
salutes, and returns to place, entering ranks from rear of
line. The Color Guard, wheels right, marches to post, Guards
stand at attention while the Bearer places flag, salutes, and
about-faces. The Guards step forward, about-face, and the
Color Guard wheels and returns to ranks.</p>

<p>10. "Fall Out."</p>

<p>11. Business Meeting.</p>

<p>12. Scout activities, including work for tests and badges,
singing games and discussion of Scout principles.</p>

<p>13. Closing Exercises.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Closing Exercises</b></div>

<p>1. "Fall In."</p>

<p>2. America, or Battle Hymn of the Republic.</p>

<p>3. "Dismissed." Scouts salute Captain.</p>

<p>The form for opening and closing exercises suggested
above takes only 20 minutes and is a practical method of
ensuring uniformity when groups from different troops
come together. Troops may use more elaborate forms,
depending upon the amount of time which the girls wish
to spend upon this type of work. For instance:</p>

<p>(a) In a troop composed of many patrols each Corporal
forms her patrol and reports to the Lieutenant, who
in turn reports to the Captain, "The company is formed,"
etc.</p>

<p>(b) In dismissing, troops with a bugler may play
"Taps" or may sing the same to words locally composed.</p>

<p>(c) In some troops Corporals give commands. This is
good because it emphasizes the patrol system.</p>

<p>But the form outlined is given as the minimum requirement,
and troops using it need never feel at a loss in large
rallies, for every ceremony necessary to express the Scout
spirit with dignity is there.</p>

<p>No additions made locally should change the essential
order of these exercises, all additions which are made
being merely amplifications of it in detail, which may not
be possible nor desirable in every community.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Business Meeting</b></div>

<p>The meeting opens with the Chairman, Secretary and
Treasurer in place, with the Secretary at the right and the
Treasurer at the left of the Chairman. The idea is to
have every Scout in the troop learn to be the Chairman so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that any and all could act in the capacity of a Business
Chairman at any kind of meeting.</p>

<p>The meeting is called to order by the Chairman. "Will
the meeting please come to order?"</p>

<p>The Chairman asks the Secretary to call the roll. "Will
the Secretary call the roll? And will the Treasurer collect
the dues?"</p>

<p>The Chairman calls for the Secretary's report. "Will
the Secretary read the minutes of the last meeting?"</p>

<p>The Chairman calls for corrections of the minutes. "Are
there any corrections?"</p>

<p>If there are none she says: "If not, the minutes stand
approved."</p>

<p>If there are corrections the Chairman calls for further
corrections, "Are there further corrections, etc. If not,
the minutes stand approved as corrected."</p>

<p>Form of Secretary's report: "The regular meeting of
Pansy Troop No. 5, held at the club house, on April 4th,
was called to order at 3 o'clock. In the absence of the
Chairman, Scout &mdash;&mdash; took the chair. The minutes
of the previous meeting were read and approved, dues
collected amounted to &mdash;&mdash;. After &mdash;&mdash; was discussed
and voted upon, the meeting adjourned."</p>

<p>The Chairman calls for the Treasurer's report. "Will
the Treasurer give her report?"</p>

<p>Form of Treasurer's report:</p>


<div class='center'>

</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chairman calls for corrections as before.</p>

<p>Then the Chairman calls for a discussion of old business,
that is, anything discussed at previous meetings,
that has been left undone or left to be decided at a later
date. Any member of the meeting may bring up this old
business, or the Chairman may start the discussion. "The
business before the meeting is &mdash;&mdash;. What is your
pleasure in regard to this," or "Will anyone make a motion?"</p>

<p>The member who wishes to make the motion says:
"Madam Chairman, I move that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Another member who agrees to this says: "I second
the motion."</p>

<p>If the motion is not seconded at once, the Chairman
says: "Will anyone second the motion?"</p>

<p>After the motion has been moved and seconded the
Chairman immediately states the question as, "It has been
moved and seconded that the troop have a Rally on May
2. Are you ready for the question?" or "The question
is now open for discussion." If no one rises, the Chairman
proceeds to put the question. "All those in favor
say aye, opposed no."</p>

<p>Then the Chairman says, "The motion is carried," or
"The motion is not carried," as the case may be.</p>

<p>After the old business has been attended to, the Chairman
calls for new business, saying, "Is there any new
business to be discussed?"</p>

<p>The Chairman then dismisses the meeting by calling
for a motion for adjournment.</p>

<p>Adjournment: "Will some one move that the meeting
be adjourned?"</p>

<p>If this is moved and seconded it is not necessary to put
it to a vote.</p>

<p>The Chairman says: "The meeting is adjourned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>"</p>

<h2>SECTION VII</h2>

<h3>GIRL SCOUT CLASS TESTS</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><b>1. Tenderfoot Test</b></div>

<p>Before enrolling as a Tenderfoot a girl must be ten
years old and have attended at least four meetings, covering
at least one month in time. In addition to the material
covered by the test, the Captain must have thoroughly
explained to her the meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance
to the Flag, the Scout Promise and the Scout Laws, and
be sure of her general understanding of them as well as
of her ability to respect them. This test is given by the
Troop Captain.</p>


<div class="center"><br /><b>Tenderfoot Test</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>1. What are the Scout Promise and the Scout Laws?</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Head</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Give them as printed in Handbook.</div>

<div class='hang1'>2. Demonstrate the Scout Salute. When do Scouts
use the Salute?</div>

<div class='hang1'>3. What are the Scout Slogan and the Scout Motto?</div>

<div class='hang1'>4. How is the respect due the American Flag expressed?
Give the Pledge of Allegiance.</div>

<div class='hang1'>5. What are the words of the first and last stanza of
The Star-Spangled Banner?</div>

<div class='hang1'>6. What is the full name of the President of the
United States?<br />

What is the full name of the Governor of your
State?<br />

What is the full name of the highest city, town or
village official where you live?</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Hands</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>7. Make or draw an American Flag, using correct
proportions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang1'>8. Tie the Reef, Bowline, Clove-hitch and Sheep-shank
knots according to instructions given in Handbook,
and tell use of each.<br />

Whip the end of a piece of rope. Indicate and
define the three parts of a rope.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Helpfulness</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>9. Present record that you have saved or earned
enough money to buy some part of the Scout uniform
or insignia.</div>

<p>Recommended: Practice Setting-up Exercises, Scout
positions and Tenderfoot Drill as shown in Handbook.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>II. Second Class Test</b></div>

<p>While it is not necessary to devote any specified length
of time to the training for this test, it is well to remember
that if too long a time is taken, either because of lack of
interest on the part of the Troop, or too inflexible standards
on the part of the Captain, the possibility of winning
Merit Badges is delayed and the feeling of steady progress
is likely to be lost. The girls should be urged to keep together
as a body, and reminded that regular attendance
and team-work will be fairer to all. Quick learners can
spend their extra time on private or group preparation
for their Merit Badges, for which they become eligible
as soon as they have passed the test, but not before.</p>

<p>This test may be given by the Troop Captain, or at her
request by another Captain or competent authority, such
as a registered nurse for bedmaking, health officer for
First Aid, fire chief for fire prevention, and so forth.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Second Class Scout Test</b></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Head</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>1. What is the history of the American Flag, and for
what does it stand?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang1'>2. Describe six animals, six birds, six trees and six
flowers.</div>

<div class='hang1'>3. What are the sixteen points of the compass? Show
how to use a compass.</div>

<div class='hang1'>4. How may fire be prevented, and what should a
Scout do in case of fire?</div>

<div class='hang1'>5. Send and receive the alphabet of the General Service
or Semaphore Code.</div>

<div class='hang1'>6. Demonstrate ability to observe quickly and accurately
by describing the contents of a room or a shop
window, <i>or</i> a table with a number of objects upon
it, after looking a short time, (not more than ten
seconds); <i>or</i> describe a passer-by so that another
person could identify him; <i>or</i> prove ability to make
a quick rough report on the appearance and landmarks
of a stretch of country, not to exceed one-quarter
of a mile and to be covered in not more than
five minutes. Report should include such things as
ground surface, buildings in sight, trees, animals,
etc.<br />

(Note: This territory must have been gone over by
person administering the test. The test is not to
be confused with the First Class requirement for
map making. It may be made the object of a hike,
and tested in groups or singly. Artificial hazards
may be arranged.)</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Hands</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>7. Lay and light a fire in a stove, using not more than
two matches, or light a gas range, top burner, oven
and boiler, without having the gas blow or smoke.
Lay and light a fire in the open, using no artificial
tinder, such as paper or excelsior, and not more
than two matches.</div>

<div class='hang1'>8. Cook so that it may be eaten, seasoning properly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
one simple dish, such as cereal, vegetables, meat,
fish or eggs in any other form than boiled.</div>

<div class='hang1'>9. Set a table correctly for a meal of two courses.</div>

<div class='hang1'>10. Make ordinary and hospital bed, and show how to
air them.</div>

<div class='hang1'>11. Present samples of seaming, hemming, darning, and
either knitting or crocheting, and press out a Scout
uniform, as sample of ironing.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Health</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>12. Demonstrate the way to stop bleeding, remove speck
from eye, treat ivy poisoning, bandage a sprained
ankle, remove a splinter.</div>

<div class='hang1'>13. What do you consider the main points to remember
about Health?</div>

<div class='hang1'>(Note: This is based on a knowledge of the section in
the Handbook on Personal Health. It is suggested
that a good way to demonstrate practically a knowledge
of the main points is to keep for a month the
Daily Health Record. This will incidentally complete
one-third of the requirement for Health Winner's
Badge.)</div>

<div class='hang1'>14. What are your height and weight, and how do they
compare with the standard?</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Helpfulness</b></div>

<div class='hang1'>15. Present to Captain or Council the proof of satisfactory
service to Troop, Church or Community.</div>

<div class='hang1'>16. Earn or save enough money for some part of personal
or troop equipment.</div>

<p>Recommended: Practice Setting-up Exercises and
Second Class Drill.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>III. First Class Test</b></div>

<p>Work on this test should not be hurried. It is purposely
made more thorough and more difficult, because it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
designed for the older and longer trained Scout. The
work for the Merit Badges, which all Scouts enjoy, should
not be considered as interfering with this period, as such
work is also the preparation for a possible Golden Eaglet
degree. As a general rule, girls under fifteen are not
likely to make thoroughly trained First Class Scouts, nor
is the community likely to take their technical ability in
the important subjects very seriously. The First Class
Scout is the ideal Scout, of whom the organization has
every right to feel proud; and ability to grasp a subject
quickly and memorize details is not so important as practical
efficiency, reliability and demonstrated usefulness to
the Troop and the community. While the standard must
not be set so high as to discourage the average girl, impatience
to get through in any given time should not be

<h3>WHAT A GIRL SCOUT SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT THE FLAG</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>We take the star from Heaven, the red from our mother
country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing we have
separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity
representing liberty.</i>&mdash;<i>George Washington.</i></p></div>

<p>The American flag is the symbol of the one-ness of the
nation: when a Girl Scout salutes the flag, therefore, she
salutes the whole country. The American Flag is known
as "Old Glory," "Stars and Stripes," "Star-Spangled Banner,"
and "The Red, White and Blue."</p>

<p>The American flag today consists of red and white
stripes, with the blue field, sometimes known as the Union
in the upper left-hand corner, with forty-eight white stars.
The thirteen stripes stand for the thirteen original States&mdash;New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
New York, New Jersey, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pennyslvania'">Pennsylvania</ins>, Delaware,
Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Georgia. The stars stand for the States now in the
Union.</p>

<p>The colors of the flag are red, representing valor; white,
representing hope, purity and truth; blue, representing
loyalty, sincerity and justice. The five-pointed star,
which is used, tradition says, at Betsy Ross' suggestion,
is the sign of infinity.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>History of the American Flag</b></div>

<p>We think of ourselves as a young country, but we
have one of the oldest written Constitutions under which
a Nation operates, and our flag is one of the oldest in
existence.</p>

<p>When our forefathers came from Europe to settle in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
this country, which is now the United States, they brought
with them the flags of their home countries, and planted
them on the new territory in symbol of taking possession
of it in the name of their liege kings and lands. Gradually
the colonies came to belong to England, and the Union
Jack became the flag of all, with the thirteen colonies represented
by thirteen stripes and the Union Jack in the
corner. This flag was known as the Grand Union or
Cambridge Flag, and was displayed when Washington
first took command of the army at Cambridge. It was
raised on December 3, 1775, on the <i>Alfred</i>, flagship of the
new little American Navy, by the senior Lieutenant of the
ship, John Paul Jones, who later defended it gallantly
in many battles at sea.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1776, the Declaration of Independence
was signed in Philadelphia and the United Colonies dissolved
all ties that bound them to England and became
an independent nation&mdash;the United States. It was immediately
necessary to adopt a new flag, as the new nation
would not use the Union Jack. Tradition says that in the
latter part of May, 1776, George Washington, Robert
Morris and Colonel Ross called on Betsy Ross in Philadelphia
to make the first flag, which they designed. They
kept the thirteen stripes of the Colonial flag, but replaced
the Union Jack by a blue field bearing thirteen stars, arranged
in a circle.</p>

<p>The birthday of the flag was June 14, 1777, when
Congress passed this resolution: Resolved: That the
flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes; alternate
red and white; that the union be thirteen stars,
white on a blue field, representing a constellation.</p>

<p>The first American unfurling the Stars and Stripes over
a warship was John Paul Jones when he took command
of the <i>Ranger</i> in June, 1777. Tradition says that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
flag was made for John Paul Jones by the young ladies
of Portsmouth Harbor, and that it was made for him from
their own and their mothers' gowns. It was this flag, in
February, 1778, that had the honor of receiving from
France the first official salute accorded by a foreign nation
to the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>It was first carried into battle at the Battle of Brandywine
in September, 1777, when Lafayette fought with the
Colonists and was wounded. This was the famous flag
made out of a soldier's white shirt, a woman's red petticoat,
and an officer's blue cloak. A famous flag now in the
National Museum in Washington is the Flag of fifteen
stars and stripes, which floated over Fort McHenry&mdash;near
Baltimore&mdash;in the War of 1812, and which Francis
Scott Key (imprisoned on a British ship) saw "by the
dawn's early light" after watching through the night "the
rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air" as proof
that the fort had not fallen to the enemy. The next day
he wrote "The Star-Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>It is said that peace has its victories as well as war,
and Scouts will want to know that our flag flew from the
first vessel ever propelled by steam&mdash;Robert Fulton's
<i>Clermont</i>.</p>

<p>It was carried by Wilbur Wright on his first successful
airplane flight in France.</p>

<p>It was the flag planted at the North Pole by Robert
Peary.</p>

<p>It was the National emblem painted upon the first
airplane to make the transatlantic flight, May, 1919.</p>

<p>At first, when states came into the Union, a new stripe
and a new star were added to the flag, but it was soon evident
that the added stripes would make it very unwieldly.
So on April 4, 1818, Congress passed this act to establish
the flag of the United States:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sec. 1. Be it enacted ... That from and after
the 4th of July next, the flag of the United States be
thirteen horizontal stripes, alternate red and white; that
the union have twenty stars, white on a blue field.</p>

<p>"Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, that, on admission of
every new State into the Union, one star be added to the
union of the flag; and that such addition shall take effect
on the 4th day of July succeeding such admission."</p>

<p>In 1917 after the United States entered the World
War, the Stars and Stripes were placed with the flags
of the Allies in the great English Cathedral of St. Paul's
in London, and on April 20, 1917, the flag was hoisted
beside the English flag over the House of Parliament as
a symbol that the two great English-speaking nations of
the world had joined hands in the cause of human brotherhood.</p>


<h3><br />RESPECT DUE THE FLAG</h3>

<p>1. The flag should be raised at sunrise and lowered
at sunset. It should not be displayed on stormy days
or left out over night, except during war. Although
there is no authoritative ruling which compels civilians to
lower the flag at sundown, good taste should impel them
to follow the traditions of the Army and Navy in this sundown
ceremonial. Primarily, the flag is raised to be seen
and secondarily, the flag is something to be guarded,
treasured, and so tradition holds it shall not be menaced by
the darkness. To leave the flag out at night, unattended,
is proof of shiftlessness, or at least carelessness.</p>

<p>2. At retreat, sunset, civilian spectators should stand
at attention. Girl Scouts, if in uniform, may give their
salute.</p>

<p>When the national colors are passing on parade or in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
review, Scouts should, if walking, halt, and if sitting, rise
and stand at attention. When the flag is stationary it is
not saluted.</p>

<p>An old, torn, or soiled flag should not be thrown away,
but should be destroyed, preferably by burning.</p>

<p>The law specifically forbids the use of and the representation
of the flag in any manner or in any connection
with merchandise for sale.</p>

<p>When the "Star-Spangled Banner" is played or sung,
stand and remain standing in silence until it is finished.</p>

<p>The flag should, on being retired, never be allowed to
touch the ground.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Regulations for Flying the Flag</b></div>

<p>1. The flag should not be raised before sunrise, nor
be allowed to remain up after sunset.</p>

<p>2. In placing the flag at half mast, it should be raised
first to full mast, and then lowered to the half mast position,
from which it should again be raised to full mast
before lowering.</p>

<p>3. The flag should never be draped.</p>

<p>4. When the flag is hung against a wall, the blue field
should be in the upper left corner if the stripes are horizontal;
in the upper right corners if the stripes are vertical.</p>

<p>5. In the case of flags hung across the street it is necessary
to hang them by the points of the compass instead
of right or left, because the right or left naturally varies
according to whether the spectator is going up or down
the street. When the flag is hung across a north and
south street, the blue fields should be toward the east,
the rising sun, when across an east and west street, the
field should be toward the north.</p>

<p>6. The flags of two or more nations displayed together
should always be hung at the same level, and should be on
separate staffs or halyards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>7. In the United States, when the American flag is
carried with one other flag, it should be at the right. When
it is carried with two other flags, it should be in the middle.</p>

<p>8. When the American flag is hung against a wall with
other flags, it is placed at the spectator's right, if it is
one of two; and in the middle, if it is one of three.</p>

<p>9. The flag at half mast is a sign of mourning.</p>

<p>10. The flag flown upside down is a signal of distress.</p>

<p>11. On Memorial Day, May 30, the flag is flown at
half mast during the morning, and is raised at noon to full
mast for the rest of the day.</p>

&mdash;<i>Francis Scott Key</i>, 1814.<br />
</div>

<p><i>The Star Spangled Banner</i> was written in 1814 by
Francis Scott Key at the time of the bombardment of
Fort McHenry, near Baltimore, by the British. Key
had been sent to the British squadron to negotiate the
release of an American prisoner-of-war, and was detained
there by the British during the engagement for
fear he might reveal their plans. The bombardment
lasted all through the night. In his joy the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
morning at seeing the American flag still flying over
Fort McHenry, Key wrote the first stanza of the <i>Star
Spangled Banner</i> on the back of an old letter, which he
drew from his pocket. He finished the poem later in
the day after he had been allowed to land. The poem
was first printed as a handbill enclosed in a fancy border;
but one of Key's friends, Judge Nicholson, of Baltimore,
saw that the tune of <i>Anacreon in Heaven</i>, an old English
drinking song, fitted the words, and the two were quickly
united with astonishing success. The old flag which
prompted the poem is still in existence; it was made by
Mrs. Mary Pickersgill.</p>

&mdash;Samuel F. Smith, 1832.<br />
</div>

<p>"America" was written in 1832 by Samuel Francis
Smith, a graduate of Harvard, at that time studying for
the ministry at Andover, Mass. The circumstances attending
the writing of this hymn are told by the author in
the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>

Newton Centre, Mass., June 5, 1887.<br />
</div>

Mr. J. H. Johnson:<br />

<p>Dear Sir: The hymn "America" was not written with
reference to any special occasion. A friend (Mr. Lowell
Mason) put into my hands a quantity of music books in
the German language early in the year 1832&mdash;because, as
he said, I could read them and he couldn't&mdash;with the
request that I would translate any of the hymns and
songs which struck my fancy, or, neglecting the German
words, with hymns or songs of my own, adapted to the
tunes, so that he could use the music. On a dismal day
in February, turning over the leaves of one of these
music books, I fell in with the tune, which pleased me&mdash;and
observing at a glance that the words were patriotic,
without attempting to imitate them, or even read them
throughout, I was moved at once to write a song adapted
to the music&mdash;and "America" is the result. I had no
thought of writing a national hymn, and was surprised
when it came to be widely used. I gave it to Mr. Mason
soon after it was written, and have since learned that
he greatly admired it. It was first publicly used at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Sabbath school celebration of Independence in Park Street
Church, Boston, on the 4th of July, 1832.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Respectfully,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">S. F. Smith.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>The tune of "America," which Samuel Smith took
from a German song book, was originally a French air.
This French air was borrowed in 1739 by an Englishman,
Henry Carey, who recast it for the British national
anthem, "God Save the King." Switzerland, Prussia and
other German States, and the United States have used
the music for their national hymns.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>How to Make an American Flag</b></div>

<p>The exact proportions of the American Flag have been
fixed by executive order; that is to say, by order of the
President, as have other features, such as the arrangement
and position of the stars. The exact size of the
flag is variable, though the army has several regulation
sizes. The cut given below shows the dimensions of
one of the regulation army flags. The proportions fixed
by executive order on May 26, 1916, are as follows:</p>

<p>If the width of the flag be taken as the basis and
called 1, then</p>

<p>The length will be 1.9,</p>

<p>Each stripe will be 1/13 of 1,</p>

<p>The blue field will be .76 long and 7/13 of 1 wide.</p>

<p>Other features of the officially designed flag are as
follows: The top and bottom stripes are red. Each State
is represented by a five-pointed star, one of whose points
shall be directed toward the top of the flag.</p>

<p>Beginning with the upper left-hand corner and reading
from left to right the stars indicate the States in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of their ratification of the Constitution and their admission
to the Union. Find your State's star in the following

<span class="caption">AN EASY WAY TO DRAW THE FLAG</span>
</div>




<div class="blockquot"><p>The sketch shows the steps in getting a flag drawn according to
national requirements.</p>

<p>1. Draw the outline of your flag, making for convenience, the
width equal an even 10 units (such as eighths or quarters or half,
etc.) so that the length can be made 19 units.</p>

<p>2. Get the 13 stripes outlined as follows: a) Take your ruler and
find a place marking 13 units, such as 3-1/4 inches, or 6-1/2 or even
9-3/4 inches. b) Then draw the 2 lines A B and A' B'; marking off
the 13 points on each. It does not matter where the lines are drawn
so long as they extend between the top and bottom of the rectangle.
c) Through these points draw lightly, the lines for the stripes,
covering the <i>whole</i> flag.</p>

<p>3. Before making the final lines, block in the union in the upper
left hand corner, making its length equal to 7.6 of the original units
used for the whole flag. The width of the union is <i>seven</i> stripes.</p>

<p>4. Place the stars as follows: The lines marking the stripes
may be used to mark the 6 lines of stars. The eight stars to a line
may be determined by dividing the length of the union into nine
parts and dropping eight perpendiculars through the six lines already
there. In the sketch the line, D F and D&acute; F&acute; are guide lines to make
the new parallel lines. These are made just as in the case of A B
and A&acute; B&acute; only containing nine units and extending between the
two sides of the union.</p>

<p>5. The stars are made at the intersection of the lines. It is not
necessary to put in more than one or two, to show the shape and
direction of points.</p>

<p>6. The stripes may be colored, or if indicated by cross hatching,
make the cross hatches vertical (I I I I I) which is the symbol for red.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h3>PARADE FORMATION FOR GIRL SCOUTS</h3>

<p>The accompanying Cut 1 indicates a suggested formation
for patriotic, Civic or Girl Scout parades when Scout officials
take part in the parade. It should be noted that the Scouts
are represented by a column of four ranks, the Color Guard
marching in the center of the column. Should a larger number
of Scouts participate in the parade, the Color Guard must
be changed to a position in the center of the longer column.</p>

<p>Cut 2 indicates a more simple form of parade which has
been found of service and effectiveness. In this formation
the Color Guard follows the band or Scout buglers. The
local director or her representative marches directly behind
the Color Guard and is followed by the Scouts in column
formation, each double rank commanded by a captain, who
marches three paces in front of the front rank, and a lieutenant,
who marches at the extreme left of the double rank
one step ahead of the front rank. Front and rear ranks
march forty inches apart.</p>

<p>It is not usually possible, nor is it necessarily advisable, to
use one <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'troup'">troop</ins> in forming a double rank. The important
thing is to have in each line the number of Scouts designated
by the person in charge of the parade. This number, determined
by the width of the street and the number marching,
will be either four, eight, twelve or sixteen. If girls of
the same height march together, the shorter preceding the
taller, the appearance of the column will be more uniform and
pleasing.</p>

<p>When Scout troop flags are used, they are carried in the
column at the extreme right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<h2>SECTION IX</h2>

<h3>GIRL SCOUT DRILL</h3>

<p>Although the simple exercises in opening and closing
a meeting are the only formal work necessary for Scouts,
the Scout Drill outlined in this Handbook is added for
Captains as a suggestion for handling one or more
Patrols in the club room, or on the street, in an orderly
dignified manner.</p>

<p>Where the Troop and Captain are interested in this
form of activity, it adds a great variety to the Scout meetings,
and its value in giving an erect carriage, alert habit
of obedience, and ability to think and act quickly are undoubted.</p>

<p>In case of rallies and parades it is practically the only
way of handling large bodies of Scouts from different
localities.</p>

<p>Every order and formation here recommended is taken
from the United States Infantry Drill Regulations, and
it is now possible for Captains in all localities to secure
the assistance of some returned soldier glad to give a
half hour occasionally to drilling the Scouts.</p>

<p>The simple formations selected have been divided into
Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class groups entirely
for the convenience of the Captain; none of the work is
too difficult for a Second Class Scout and there is nothing
to prevent a Tenderfoot from taking all of it, if the troop
should be particularly interested in drilling.</p>

<div class='hang1'>Commands are divided into two classes:<br />

(a) The preparatory, to tell the Scout <i>what</i> to do, and<br />

(b) The command of execution, to tell <i>how</i> to do it.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Tenderfoot Drill Schedule</b></div>

<div class='center'><br /><b>"FALL IN"</b></div>

<p>At this command each Scout immediately takes her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
position in the Patrol to which she belongs (the captain
having already assigned to each Scout her exact place),
and without further order assumes the position of "<i>Attention</i>"
three paces in front of Captain.</p>

<p>The position of <i>Attention</i> is: body and head erect,
head, shoulders and pelvis in same plane, eyes front, arms
hanging easily at the sides, feet parallel and about four
inches apart; perfect silence to be maintained.</p>

<p>Patrol formation, two ranks (rows) of four Scouts
each, forty inches between front and rear ranks. The
patrol corresponds to the military unit of the squad.</p>

<p>Other patrols will fall in on the left of patrol No. 1
and on a line with it, in their numerical order. When
assembled a troop of four patrols will be in the position
indicated by the following diagram, and facing the captain.</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Patrol diagram">
<tr><td align='left'>5678&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>5678</td><td align='left'>5678&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>5678</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>Lieut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>Capt.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>If the Captain prefers, and where there are only a few
Scouts to be handled, they may be drawn up in a single
rank facing the Captain. In either position they are now
ready for the preliminaries of military drill.</p>

<div class='unindent'>1. <i>Right</i> (or left) <i>Dress</i>. 2. <i>Front.</i></div>

<p>At the command <i>"Dress"</i> whether to right or left, all
Scouts place the left hand on the hip. Each Scout, except
the base file, Scout on right or left end from whom
the other take their alignment, when on or near the new
line, executes "<i>Eyes Right!</i>" and taking steps of two or
three inches, places herself so that her right arm rests
lightly against the arm of the Scout on her right, and so
that her eyes and shoulders are in line with those of the
Scout on her right; the rear rank Scouts cover in file.
The instructor verifies the alignment of both ranks from
the right flank and orders up or back such Scouts as may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
be in rear or in advance of the line: only the Scouts
designated move.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>At the command "<i>Front,</i>" given when the ranks are
aligned, each Scout turns her head and eyes to the front
and drops the hand at her side.</p>

<p>To march the patrol or troop in column of twos, the
preliminary commands would be as just given: 1. <i>Fall in.</i>
2. <i>Right Dress.</i> 3. <i>Front.</i></p>

<p>The troop is then drawn up facing the Captain in two
ranks as described. The Captain then commands:</p>

<p>1. <i>Right</i> (or left) <i>Face</i> (According to the direction in
which the column is to proceed.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Forward.</i> 3. <i>March.</i></p>

<p>At the command "<i>March</i>," each Scout steps off smartly
with the <i>left</i> foot.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Facings</b></div>

<div class='unindent'>To the flank: "<i>Right</i> (or left) <i>Face</i>."</div>

<p>Raise slightly the left heel and the right toe; face to
the right, turning on the right heel, assisted by a slight
pressure on the ball of the left foot; place the left foot
by the side of the right. "Left Face" is executed on the
left heel in the corresponding manner. Right (or left)
Half Face is executed similarly, facing forty-five degrees.</p>

<div class='unindent'>To the rear: <i>About Face.</i></div>

<p>Carry the toe of the right foot about half a foot length
to the rear and slightly to the left of the left heel without
changing the position of the left foot; face to the rear,
turning to the right on the left heel and right toe; place
the right heel by the side of the left.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Eyes Right or Left</b></div>

<div class='unindent'>1. <i>Eyes Right</i> (or left). <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '3'">2</ins>. <i>Front.</i></div>

<p>At the command "Right," turn the head to the right
oblique, eyes fixed on the line of Scouts in, or supposed
to be in, the same rank. At the command "<i>Front</i>" turn
the head and eyes to the front.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>The Rests</b></div>

<p>Being at halt, the commands for the different rests are
as follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fall Out</span>, <span class="smcap">Rest</span>, <span class="smcap">At Ease</span> and <span class="smcap">1 Parade, 2 Rest</span>.</p>

<p>At the command <i>Fall Out</i>, the Scouts may leave the
ranks, but are required to remain in the immediate vicinity.
They resume their former places, at attention at
the command "<i>Fall In</i>."</p>

<p>At the command "<i>Rest</i>" each Scout keeps one foot in
place, but is not required to keep silence or immobility.</p>

<p>At the command <i>"At Ease"</i> each Scout keeps one foot
in place and is required to keep silence but not immobility.</p>


<div class='unindent'><i>1 Parade, 2 Rest.</i></div>

<p>Carry the right foot six inches straight to the rear,
left knee slightly bent; clasp the hands, without constraint,
in front of the center of the body, fingers joined,
right hand uppermost, left thumb clasped by the thumb
and forefinger of the right hand; preserve silence and
steadiness of position.</p>

<p>To resume the attention: <i>1 Squad (or Company) 2
Attention.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Steps and Marchings</b></div>

<p>All steps and marchings executed from the halt, except
right step, begin with the left foot.</p>

<p>The length of the full step in "<i>Quick Time</i>" for a
Scout is twenty inches, measured from heel to heel, and
the cadence is at the rate of one hundred twenty steps
per minute.</p>

<p>The length of the full step in "<i>Double Time</i>," for a
Scout, is about twenty-four inches; the cadence is at the
rate of one hundred eighty steps per minute.</p>

<p>The instructor, when necessary, indicates the cadence
of the step by calling "One, Two, Three, Four," or "Left,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Right, Left, Right," the instant the left and right foot,
respectively, should be planted.</p>

<p>All steps and marchings and movements involving march
are executed in "Quick Time" unless the squad (or
company) be marching in "Double Time."</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Quick Time</b></div>

<p>Being at a halt, to march forward in quick time: 1 <i>Forward</i>,

<div class='center'><br /><b>Alignments</b></div>

<p>1 <i>Right (or Left) Dress</i>, 2 <i>Front</i>. (Described in Tenderfoot
Drill.)</p>

<p>To preserve the alignment when marching; <i>Guide Right</i>
(<i>or left</i>). The Scouts preserve their intervals from the
side of the guide, yielding to pressure on that side and
resisting pressure from the opposite direction; they recover
intervals, if lost, by gradually opening out or closing
in; they recover alignment by slightly lengthening or
shortening the step; the rear rank Scouts cover their file
leaders at forty inches.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Take Distance</b></div>

<p>(Formation for signalling or for setting-up exercises.)</p>

<p>Being in line at a halt having counted off: 1 <i>Take
Distance at four paces</i>, 2 <i>March</i>; 3 <i>Squad (or company),
Halt</i>.</p>

<p>At the command <i>March</i>, each Scout in succession starting
at four paces apart and beginning with No. 1 of the
front rank, followed by 2, 3, 4 and 1, 2, 3, 4 of the rear
rank, marches straight forward until the order Squad,
Halt is given. The command <i>Halt</i> is given when all have
their distances.</p>

<p>(Word to instructors: Where the floor space is limited
it is advisable to have the Scouts take the half step in
executing this formation or move at two paces.)</p>

<p>If more than one squad is in line, each squad executes
the movement as above simultaneously.</p>

<p>Being at distances, to assemble the squad (or company):</p>

<div class='unindent'>1 <i>Assemble</i>, 2 <i>March</i>.</div>

<p>At the command <i>March</i>, No. 1 of the front rank
stands fast; the other members move forward to their
proper places in the line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Oblique March</b></div>

<p>For the instruction of the recruits, the squad being in
column or correctly aligned, the instructor causes the
Scouts to face half right and half left, points out to them
their relative positions, and explains that these are to be
maintained in the oblique march.</p>

<div class='unindent'>1 <i>Right (or Left) Oblique</i>, 2 <i>March</i>.</div>

<p>At the command <i>March</i>, each Scout steps off in a direction
forty-five degrees to the right of her original front.
She preserves her relative position, keeping her shoulders
parallel to those of the guide, and so regulates her steps
that the ranks remain parallel to their original front.</p>

<p>At the command <i>Halt</i> the Scouts face to the front.</p>

<p>To resume the original directions: 1 <i>Forward</i>, 2 <i>March</i>.</p>

<p>The Scouts half face to the left in marching and then
move straight to the front.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Turn on Moving Pivot</b></div>

<p>Begin in line: 1 <i>Right (or left) Turn</i>, 2 <i>March</i>.</p>

<p>(This applies to the single squad; if the whole troop
is drilling and is in column of squads, or twos, the command
would be: 1 <i>Column Right</i> (<i>or left</i>), 2 <i>March</i>.)</p>

<p>The movement is executed by each rank successively
and on the same ground. At the second command, the
pivot Scout of the front rank faces to the right in marching
and takes the half step; the other Scouts of the rank
oblique to the right until opposite their places in line,
then execute a second right oblique and take the half step
on arriving abreast of the pivot Scout. All glance toward
the marching flank while at half step and take the full step
without command as the last Scout arrives on the line.</p>

<p><i>Right</i> (<i>or left</i>) Half Turn is executed in a similar
manner. The pivot Scout makes a half change of direction
to the right and the other Scouts make quarter
changes in obliquing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Turn on a Fixed Pivot</b></div>

<p>Being in line, to turn and march: 1 <i>Squad Right</i> (<i>or
left</i>), 2 <i>March</i>.</p>

<p>At the second command, the right flank Scout in the
front rank faces to the right in marching and marks
time; the other front rank Scouts oblique to the right,
place themselves abreast of the pivot, and mark time. In
the rear rank the third Scout from the right, followed
in column by the second and first, moves straight to the
front until in the rear of her front rank Scout, when all
face to the right in marching and mark time; the other
number of the rear rank moves straight to the front four
paces and places herself abreast of the Scout on her
right. Scouts on the new line glance toward the marching
flank while marking time and, as the last Scout arrives on
the line, both ranks execute <i>Forward March</i> without
further command.</p>

<p>Being in line to turn and halt: 1 <i>Squad Right</i> (<i>or left</i>),
2 <i>March</i>, 3 <i>Squad</i>, 4 <i>Halt</i>.</p>

<p>The third command is given immediately after the
second. The turn is executed as prescribed in the preceding
paragraph except that all Scouts, on arriving on
the new line mark time until the fourth command is
given, when all halt. The fourth command should be
given as the last Scout arrives on the line.</p>

<p>Being in line to turn about and march: 1 <i>Squad Right
(or left) About</i>, 2 <i>March</i>.</p>

<p>At the second command the front rank twice executes
Squad Right initiating the second Squad Right when
the Scout on the marching flank has arrived abreast of
the rank. In the rear rank the third Scout from the

<h3>SIGNALLING FOR SCOUTS</h3>


<h3><br />A. GENERAL SERVICE CODE</h3>

<p>The General Service Code, given herewith, also called
the Continental Code and the International Morse Code,
is used by the Army and Navy, and for cabling and
wireless telegraphy. It is used for visual signalling by
hand, flag, Ardois lights, torches, heliograph, lanterns,
etc., and for sound signalling with buzzer, whistle, etc.</p>

<p>The American Morse Code is used for commercial purposes
only, and differs from the International Morse in
a few particulars. A Scout need not concern herself with
it because it would only be used by the Scout who eventually
becomes a telegrapher, and for this purpose the
Western Union Company offers the necessary training.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Wig Wag Signalling</b></div>

<div class='center'><br /><b><small>GENERAL SERVICE CODE</small></b></div>

<p>The flag used for this signalling is square with a smaller
square of another color in the center. It may be either
white with the smaller square red, or red with the smaller
square white. A good size for Scout use is 24 inches
square with a center 9 inches square, on a pole 42 inches
long and one-half inch in diameter.</p>

<p>There are but three motions with the flag and all
start from, and are completed by, return to position,
which means the flag held perpendicularly and at rest
directly in front of the signaller.</p>

<p>Signaller should stand erect, well balanced on the
arches of the feet. The butt of the flag stick is held
lightly in the right hand; the left hand steadies and
directs the flag at a distance from six to twelve inches
above the right on the stick. The length of the stick will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
determine the position of the left hand; the longer the
stick the further apart must the hands be placed in order
to obtain the best balance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i016.png" width="425" height="282" alt="Wig Wag Signalling" title="" />
</div>

<p>DOT: To make the dot, swing the flag down to the
right until the stick reaches the horizontal and bring it
back to Position.</p>

<p>DASH: To make the dash, swing the flag to the left
until it reaches the horizontal and bring it back to Position.</p>

<p>INTERVAL: The third position is made by swinging
the flag down directly in front and returning to Position.</p>

<p>In order to keep the flag from "fouling" when making
these motions, make a sort of figure 8 with the point
of the stick. A slight turn of the wrist accomplishes
this result and becomes very easy after a little practice.
Beginners should master the three motions of the flag,
exaggerating the figure 8 motion before they attempt
to make letters. <i>It is also best to learn the code before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
attempting to wig wag it, so that the mind will be free
to concentrate upon the technique or correct managing
of the flag.</i></p>

<p>Make no pause between dots and dashes in making a
letter, but make a continuous swing from right to left,
or left to right. A pause at Position indicates the completion
of a letter.</p>

<p>One Interval (Front) indicates the completion of a
word.</p>

<p>Two Intervals indicate the completion of a sentence.</p>

<p>Three Intervals indicate the completion of a message.</p>

<p><i>Do not try for speed.</i> In all signalling, accuracy
is the important thing, for unless the letters are accurately
made they cannot be easily read, and the message
will have to be repeated. Fall into a regular easy
rhythm in sending. Speed comes with practice.</p>

<p>Signalling with a Flash Light: Use a short flash for
the dot and a long steady flash for the dash. Pause the
length of three dots between letters, and the length of
five dots between words. A still longer pause marks the
end of a sentence.</p>

<p>Signalling by Whistle: Use a short blast for the dot,
and a long steady blast for the dash. Indicate the end
of a letter, a word, and a sentence by the same pauses
as explained in Flash Light Signalling.</p>

<p>Signalling with a Lantern: The motions used in signalling
with a lantern are somewhat like those of the
wig wag flag. For Position hold the lantern directly
in front of the body; for the dot swing it to the right
and back to Position; for the dash swing it to the left
and back to Position; and for Interval move it down and
up in a vertical line directly in front. A stationary light
should be placed on the ground before the feet as a point
of reference for the various motions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>B. SEMAPHORE SIGNALLING</b><br />

<b>SEMAPHORE CODE</b></div>

<p>The semaphore is a machine with two arms which may
be moved into various positions to make letters. The
semaphore code shown in the accompanying picture may
also be employed by a person using two flags. It is the
quickest method of flag signalling but is available for
comparatively short distances, seldom over a mile, unless
extra large flags are employed or there is some extraordinary
condition of background or atmosphere.</p>

<p>The semaphore code is not adapted to as many uses
as is the general service code, but for quick signalling
over comparatively short distances, it is preferable in
every way.</p>

<p>The regulation flag is 18 inches square, either divided
diagonally into two triangles of white and red, or square
of white with small square of red in the center, or red
with small square of white. These flags are fastened on
poles 24 inches long and 1/2 inch in diameter.</p>

<p>The flags must be carefully held so that the sticks
make, as it were, a continuation of the arm bone; a bent
wrist will cause the flags to make an entirely different
angle, and consequently a different letter from the one
intended.</p>

<p>Swing the arms smoothly and without hesitation from
one letter to another. Hold each letter long enough to
make it clear to the person receiving it. Every word begins
and ends with "intervals," the hands crossed downward
in front of the body, arms nearly straight, right
hand always over the left.</p>

<p>Indicate the end of a sentence by one "chip-chop" made
by holding both flags to the right, horizontally, and moving
them up and down several times; not altogether, but
one flag going down as the other comes up, making the
"chopping" motion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i018.png" width="420" height="500" alt="CODE FOR SEMAPHORE SIGNALLING" title="" />
<span class="caption">CODE FOR SEMAPHORE SIGNALLING</span>
</div>

<p>Note: The extended arm should always make a
straight line with the flag staff.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p><i>From the very beginning practice reading as well as
sending.</i> It is harder to do and requires more practice.
Instructors should always face the class in giving a
lesson; in this way the pupil learns to read at the same
time as she is learning to make the letters. This principle
applies to all visual signalling.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Whistle Signals</b></div>

<p>1. One blast, "Attention"; "Assemble" (if scattered).</p>

<p>2. Two short blasts, "All right."</p>

<p>3. Four short blasts, calls "Patrol Leaders come here."</p>

<p>4. Alternate long and short blasts, "Mess Call."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Hand Signals</b></div>

<p>These signals are advisable when handling a troop in
a street where the voice cannot be readily heard, or in
marching the troop into some church, theatre, or other
building where a spoken command is undesirable.</p>

<p><i>Forward</i>, <i>March</i>:</p>

<p>Carry the hand to the shoulder; straighten and hold
the arm horizontally, thrusting it in the direction of the
march. (This signal is also used to execute quick time
from double time.)</p>

<p><i>Halt</i>:</p>

<p>Carry the hand to the shoulder; thrust hand upward
and hold the arm vertically.</p>

<p><i>Double Time</i>, <i>March</i>:</p>

<p>Carry the hand to the shoulder, rapidly thrust the hand
upward the full extent of the arm several times.</p>

<p><i>Squads Right</i>, <i>March</i>:</p>

<p>Raise the arm laterally until horizontal; carry it to
a vertical position above the head and swing it several
times between the vertical and horizontal positions.</p>

<p><i>Squads Left</i>, <i>March</i>:</p>

<p>Raise the arm laterally until horizontal; carry it downward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the side and swing it several times between the
downward and horizontal positions.</p>

<p><i>Change Direction or Column Right (Left) March</i>:</p>

<p>The hand on the side toward which the change of direction
is to be made is carried across the body to the opposite
shoulder, forearm horizontal; then swing in a horizontal
plane, arm extended, pointing in the new direction.</p>

<p><i>Assemble</i>:</p>

<p>Raise the arm vertically to its full extent and describe
horizontal circles.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>THE GIRL SCOUT SALUTE.</b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>How To Salute.</b> To salute, a Girl Scout raises the right hand to her
hat in line with the right temple, the first three fingers extended, and
the little finger held down by the thumb. This salute is the sign of the
Girl Scouts. The three extended fingers, like the Trefoil, represent
the three parts of the Promise.</p>

<p><b>When To Salute.</b> When Scouts meet for the first time during the day,
whether comrades or strangers, of whatever rank, they should salute
each other.</p>

<p>If in uniform a Girl Scout stands at attention and salutes the flag
when it is hoisted or lowered, and as it passes her in parade. If not in
uniform, she stands at attention, but does not salute.</p>

<p>When in uniform and in ranks in public demonstration, a Girl Scout
stands at attention and salutes when the Star Spangled Banner is
played. But she does not salute when she herself is singing.</p>

<p>In ordinary gatherings when the anthem is played, a Girl Scout stands
at attention but does not salute.</p>

<p>When Girl Scouts are on parade or marching in troop or patrol formation,
only the officers salute, at the same time giving the command,
"Eyes right," or "Eyes left," as the case may be, at which every Scout
turns her eyes sharply in the direction ordered till the officer commands,
"Eyes front."</p>

<p>When repeating the Promise, a Girl Scout stands at salute.</p>

<p>When in uniform a Girl Scout should salute her officers when speaking
to them, or when being spoken to by them.</p>

<p>If in uniform, a Girl Scout should return the salute of a Boy Scout.
She does not salute the police or military officers unless they salute
her first.</p>

<p>Girl Scouts may salute each other whether they are in uniform or not.</p>

<p><b>Pledge of Allegiance.</b> "I pledge allegiance to the flag and to the
republic for which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice
for all."</p>

<p>Girl Scouts should stand at attention, bring the hand to the full
salute at the first word of the pledge, and at the word "flag" extend the
arm, fingers still in the salute position, palm up, pointing to the flag.</p>

<p><b>Parades.</b> Girl Scouts may take part in patriotic parades with the
permission of the Local Council or Commissioner or of the Captain
where there is no Local Council.</p></div>

<h2>SECTION XI</h2>

<h3>THE SCOUT AIDE</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Introduction.</b></div>

<p>The six following subjects, Home Economics, Child
Care, First Aid, Home Nursing, Public Health, and Personal
Health are grouped together, and for proficiency in
all of them a special badge called "Scout Aide" is awarded.</p>

<p>This badge will probably be regarded by the outside
world as the most important decoration the Girl Scouts
can win, and all Scouts who will try for it should realize
that those who wear it will represent the organization in
a very special sense and will be eager to prove their
practical knowledge and ability in the important subjects
it stands for.</p>

<p>No young child could pretend to represent <span class="smcap">all</span> this
medal stands for. Any grown girl or woman should be
proud to own it.</p>

<p>Practical knowledge of Personal Health, Public Health
and Child Care will add to the efficiency and happiness of
this nation, and the women of today have a better chance
to control these things than ever before.</p>

<p>Home Nursing and First Aid will save lives for the
nation in the two great emergencies of illness and accident.</p>

<p>Household Economics, the great general business and
profession of women, if it is raised to the level of the
other great businesses and professions, and managed
quickly, efficiently and economically, will cease to be regarded
as drudgery and take its real place among the arts
and sciences.</p>

<p>When the girls of today have learned to do this, the
women of tomorrow will be spared the criticism of waste
and extravagance that our nation has had to bear. If
Girl Scouts make good as far as this medal is concerned
and become real "Scout Aides" the Scout reputation is
secure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h3>1. THE HOME MAKER</h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">By Sarah Louise Arnold</span><br />

Formerly Dean of Simmons College</div>

<p><i>The Keeper of the House.</i> Every Girl Scout knows
that good homes make a country great and good; so
every woman wants to understand home-making. Of
course that means "keeping" a house; and of course that
means that Girl Scouts should try for the Housekeeper
Merit Badge, the "Home Maker."</p>

<p>Now "making a home" doesn't mean just having it,
owning it and holding its key. It means making it a
good place to live in, or helping to make it so. This
sounds like the House that Jack built; but all this belongs
to the making of a home.</p>

<p><i>Planning Your House.</i> When you plan a house of
your own you must think what it needs most. You would
choose, first of all, to have abundant air, fresh and
clean; a dry spot where dampness will not stay; sunshine
at some time of day in every room of the house, which
you can have if your house faces southeast; and you
must be able to get a good supply of pure water. You
will want to make your house warm in the winter and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
cool in the summer, so you will look out for windows,
doors and porches.</p>

<p>Think what must be done in a house: eating, sleeping,
working, resting, by the whole family. How many rooms
must you have? Draw a plan of some house in your
neighborhood that seems good to live in. Make up your
mind what you like best in that house.</p>

<p><i>Furnishings.</i> Then houses must be furnished with the
things that the family needs. The furniture will be for
use. You must ask every piece what it is good for.
What will you do with it? Could you get along without
it? Some things you would use constantly, others once
in a while. Which would you get first if you were
planning carefully? How much would it cost to furnish
the house for which you have drawn the plans: to furnish
the kitchen, the living room, the bedrooms? Make a
list of the furniture <i>needed</i> (not just <i>wanted</i>) for each
room with the cost of each piece.</p>

<p>It is worth while for you to go to look at furniture in
stores and to think about buying it. Then you will discover
that a piece of furniture that looks well in the store
might not look at all well in your house, for furniture
must "suit" the house and the room into which it goes.
It must "fit," we say. No other furniture will do. So
the Girl Scout will make up her mind what will fit her
house; and of course this means also what will fit the
family purse. For the keeper of the house must not
let into her house one single thing that she cannot afford
to buy. She will take pride in that.</p>

<p>So when you make a list of furniture&mdash;with its price&mdash;make
sure that everything you choose, suits, or fits, <i>your</i>
house.</p>

<p><i>The Cellar.</i> Most houses are built over cellars, for
purposes of sanitation, heating and water supply, as well
as for storage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The Girl Scout who lives in the country probably
knows all about cellars for they are much needed there.
The city girl may live in an apartment and may never
think of a cellar.</p>

<p>Look at the cellars of two or three houses. How are
they built? Did you plan for one in your house?</p>

<p>The cellar should be well ventilated, having light as
well as air. Its windows should be screened; the floor
should be dry and if possible made of cement; the walls
should be whitewashed. Ashes should be kept in a galvanized
iron barrel, to prevent fire.</p>

<p>A cellar should be a clean place, corners and all.</p>

<p><i>The Kitchen.</i> The kitchen is a work-shop; it should
be sunny and airy.</p>

<p>Look out for windows to let in the fresh air and sunshine.
And while you are thinking of windows, be sure
that they can open at the top and bottom to let sweetness
in, and drive bad odors out.</p>

<p>Your kitchen should hold things that are necessary, and
nothing else. It should be easy to keep clean, having
painted walls, and the floor should be of hard pine or
else covered with linoleum. When a Girl Scout takes
care of the kitchen she is in honor bound to keep all the
corners clean and to leave no dust nor crumbs of food
anywhere about. She will take great pains to keep flies
out of the kitchen and so will have her windows screened.</p>

<p>A good kitchen is provided with a sink and if possible
with running water; and it must have a good stove, with
a place for keeping wood or coal if either is used.</p>

<p><i>The Kitchen Floor.</i> The floor of the kitchen should be
made of hard wood. Maple or hard pine will make a
good floor. A hard-wood floor can be dressed with shellac
or with oil. The wood absorbs this dressing so that
water will not soak in. A floor which has been shellacked
should be wiped with warm water. Not much water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
will be needed. The oiled floor can be wiped and dried,
then oiled lightly from time to time.</p>

<p>Linoleum or oilcloth may be used to cover an old floor.
If the floor is rough it should be made even by planing
before the linoleum is put down, and the cracks should be
filled. If you can't get linoleum you can paint your floor
with a hard floor paint. Be sure to get a paint that dries
hard. The linoleum should be frequently washed with
warm water and soap and then rinsed carefully before
it is dried.</p>

<p><i>The Kitchen Stove.</i> The chief business of the kitchen
stove is to provide heat for cooking. It must hold a fire,
and so must be made of something which will not burn.
Stoves are usually made of iron. Fire will not burn
without air, so a place must be arranged to let air into
the stove, and just enough to make the fire burn clearly
and furnish the right amount of heat. That is what the
front dampers or slides are for. The fuel, wood or
coal, is held in the fire-box. The heated air makes the
top of the stove hot for frying, broiling or boiling, and
the oven hot for baking.</p>

<p>The smoke and gases from the fire must not come out
into the room to blind our eyes or suffocate us; the
chimney is built to take care of the smoke and gases, and
there must be a way for them to get into the chimney;
the stove pipe is for this. But the game you have to
play with your stove is to let the smoke and gases run
up chimney, but to save all the heat you can for the
work to be done. So your stove is supplied with dampers.
When the fire is new, and there is much smoke or gas,
you open the damper into the stovepipe, and in the
stovepipe. Try to get a picture of the way the heated
air goes from the fire-box up into the chimney. We call
this direct draft. Of course a great deal of heat runs
away through the chimney, and so your fuel is wasted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Now if you want to save heat, and particularly if you
want to bake, and must have a hot oven, you will close the
oven damper that has made the short easy way into the
stovepipe. Then the heated air must find another way to
get to the chimney, and it has to go around the oven to do
this. While the hot air is finding its way around the oven,
it heats it, ready for your baking. We call this the "indirect
draft." Look over your kitchen stove and see how
this happens. Take off the covers, open every door, and
examine every part.</p>

<p>Stoves must be carefully managed. The fires must
burn readily and the cooking must be done with the least
possible amount of wood or coal. This means a clean
stove, free from ashes and with a clear draft. Wood or
coal will burn freely in the air. They will stop burning
if there is no draft.</p>

<p>Learn to manage your draft. Remember that stoves
are made with a damper, in order to control the current
of hot air. If the oven damper is closed this heated air
<i>must</i> pass over and around the oven before it gets to the
chimney and so heat the oven. If it is open the hot air
can immediately escape up the chimney.</p>

<p>When starting the fire leave the damper open. As
soon as it is burning well, close it so that the oven will be
heated. Your stove should also have a damper in the
pipe, to save the heat which would otherwise run up the
chimney. If there is none, have one put in. There are
also dampers or slides in front of the stove to control the
amount of air going in.</p>

<p>The housekeeper must learn how to manage her stove;
she must get acquainted with it, for every stove has its
own way. Draw a picture or plan of the stove that you
know best. See if you can tell plainly how to build a
fire in your stove. If you use natural gas or a kerosene
stove tell how that should be managed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gas and Oil Stoves.</i> Cooking may be done on an iron
stove with either coal or wood as fuel, or the stove may
be planned for burning gas or kerosene. The coal fire
must be fed several times a day with coal and the ashes
must be removed to keep the fire burning clearly. Wood
burns out quickly and must be replaced often. Both
wood and coal stoves mean almost constant care for the
housekeeper.</p>

<p>Gas gives less trouble. It comes in pipes from outside
the house. This means that somebody else&mdash;the
gas company&mdash;provides the supply. You turn on the
gas when you want to use it and turn it off, if you are
wise and thoughtful, the moment it is not needed. The
gas company measures the amount of gas that you use
by its meter, and you pay for every bit that you burn or
waste. The important thing, then, is to use as little
gas as possible in order to pay for as little as possible.
You would rather pay twenty-five cents for a thrift
stamp, than for gas that had burned simply because you
had forgotten to turn it off. Be sure that gas is turned
completely off at all places and never have a low light
burning, as the flame may be blown out and the unburned
gas escape. This would be dangerous and might even
kill persons in the house.</p>

<p>The kerosene stove may be used instead of a gas stove
in houses which are not piped for a gas supply. If wicks
are used they must be carefully trimmed, so that they will
be clean and even. A kerosene stove needs frequent
cleaning. It should be kept free from dust and from
drippings of oil.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Fireless Cooker</b></div>

<p>When a Girl Scout gets to thinking about all the work
to be done in a kitchen she will ask some very important
questions. How much work is to be done? How long
does it take to do it? Can time be saved by doing it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
a better way? How can I save labor? Save time? Save
money?</p>

<p>The Girl Scout will find the answers one at a time,
if she does her own work. And if you do your own work
you will at once call for a fireless cooker. The name
sounds impossible, for you have always cooked with a
stove, and, of course, a fire. How can you cook without
a fire?</p>

<p>The women of Norway taught us how. When they
went out to work in the fields or on the farm they took
the hot kettle of soup off the stove and hid it away
in a hay box. The hay kept the heat in the kettle instead
of letting it escape; so the soup kept on cooking, and
when the women came home from their work in the
fields there it was, all steaming hot and ready for dinner.</p>

<p>Everyone has noticed how some things carry or conduct
heat and other things don't. That's why we use a
"holder," when handling a hot dish or stove lifter or
tea-pot. The "holder" does not carry the heat to the
hand; it keeps it away. So the hay packed around the
hot kettle kept the heat in the kettle, refusing to "conduct"
it away. Therefore the soup went on cooking.</p>

<p>Your English cousins use a "cosy" to cover the hot
teapot or coffee pot. This "cosy" is made of quilted
cotton; and looks like the quilted hood that your great-grandmother
used to have. This keeps the heat in the
tea or coffee, so that you can have a second cup for the
asking.</p>

<p>America was slow to learn from her thrifty cousins,
but at last she adopted the fireless cooker; and this is
what it does:</p>

<p>The fireless cooker, a case packed with some material
which refuses to conduct heat, is used to continue the
cooking of foods after they have been made hot on
the stove. When securely covered in the cooker they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
will go on cooking for several hours because the heat is
retained by the protecting case. A Girl Scout may buy
a fireless cooker, paying from $5 to $25 for it, or she
may make one, which will cost less than one dollar. Of
course this is a challenge to make one. You may be
very sure that if you make a fireless cooker you will understand
all about it. To make a fireless cooker you
will need:</p>

<p>(1) <i>A cooker or container</i>, which should be an agate
pail with a close fitting cover. The sides should be
straight up and down, the bottom just as big as the top.
You can choose a small one holding two quarts, or a gallon
pail which would be large enough for anything an
ordinary family would be likely to cook.</p>

<p>(2) <i>A case</i>, which must be at least eight inches wider
than your container, for the packing must extend at least
four inches around the pail on every side. You may
use a round case like a big wooden candy pail, which
you can usually get at the ten cent store for ten cents; or
it may be a galvanized iron can with a cover like the one
ordinarily used for garbage; or it may be a box shaped
like a cube.</p>

<p>(3) For packing you may use crumpled newspapers
tightly packed in; or ground cork, which is used in packing
Malaga grapes, is fine, and you may be able to get
it from a fruit store. Excelsior is good, and perhaps
you will find that in the shed in some packing case; while,
if you live in the country, you may be able to get Spanish
moss. This should be dried, of course. And then there
is hay&mdash;which our Norwegian cousins use.</p>

<p>Let us try paper. Pack the box or can four inches
deep, with crumpled paper, making a very even layer.
Put a piece of pasteboard much larger than the bottom of
your pail upon this layer and set your pail in the middle
of it. Now pack the paper tightly around the pail up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to the very top, using a stick of wood or mallet to press it
down.</p>

<p>Now you must make a cloth cover for your pail in the
shape of a tall hat. The rim of the hat must reach out
to the edges of your case and be tacked there. Take out
your pail, fit this cloth cover into the hole and tack the
edge evenly to the box.</p>

<p>You must now make a cushion to fill the rest of the
box, packing it full of the crumpled paper. Make hinges
for the lid of your box and put some sort of fastener
on the front to keep the lid down tight.</p>

<p>Now you have your fireless cooker. When your oatmeal
or your stew, or your chicken, or your vegetables
have boiled ten or fifteen minutes on the stove in your
agate pail, clap on its cover, set it into the nest, push the
cushion into the top of the cooker, clamp down the lid,
and your work is done, for the cooking will go merrily on
all alone by itself in your fireless cooker.</p>

<p>While you are making your fireless cooker, remember
that the thermos bottle is made on the same principle.
And remember, too, that your non-conducting packing
material will keep heat out just as well as it keeps heat in.
In the summer time you may wish to keep your ice cream
cold for a while in your fireless cooker. Perhaps you
will see how this might help on a hot summer's day and
what a comfort a fireless cooker might prove in a sick
room.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Ice Chest. How It Is Made</b></div>

<p>In taking care of food we must be provided with a cool
place, for the storage of milk, butter, cream, and all
cooked food that may spoil. In summer this is especially
important; in an apartment, and in most city houses the
ice chest is needed all the year around; in the country,
it is needed only in the warm months.</p>

<p>The ice chest is built much as the fireless cooker is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
made. Its case is usually made of wood, its packing
material must be non-conducting, and its lining must be
some smooth surface through which water cannot pass.
Some ice chests are lined with zinc and some with porcelain
tiles. In some ice chests, food and ice are kept in
the same box, which usually opens at the top; in other
chests there is a separate chamber for the ice. From the
ice chamber a drain pipe carries away the water which
drips from the melting ice.</p>

<p>Every ice chest must be kept clean and sweet. It
should be looked over every day and washed carefully
at least once a week. No crumbs of food should be left
on the shelves. If you spill anything, wipe it up <i>clean</i>
at once.</p>

<p>The drain pipe must be kept clean. A long wire brush
is used for this. If you are buying an ice box, get one
with removable pipes, which are easily cleaned. If there
is any odor from the chest, scald with water and soda,
a teaspoonful of soda to a quart of water. Rinse with
fresh cold water.</p>

<p>If your ice chest drips into a pan which must be
emptied daily, have a regular time for emptying it. An
overflowing pan in an apartment may damage the ceiling
below. If it drips into a pan which drains itself, be
sure that the drain is kept clean and the entrance to the
pipe unclogged. Clean the drip pan whenever you clean
the ice chest.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to keep food in closed containers like
fruit jars. Wide dishes take up too much space. Containers
should be tall rather than broad.</p>

<p>Put no hot dishes in the ice box; it wastes the ice.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Iceless Refrigerator</b></div>

<p>An "iceless refrigerator" sounds like a "fireless cooker."
This is an arrangement made to keep food cool in the
summer when there is no ice. A wooden cage with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
shelves is covered with a cloth cover and placed near a
window or out of doors. If in the house it should stand
in a large pan to prevent the dripping of water on the
shelf or floor.</p>

<p>A piece of the cloth cover should rest in a pan of
water. If this is not convenient a strip of cloth can be
sewed to the cover endwise and this piece should be
placed in a pan or bowl of water which should be set on
top of the cage. This water will be sucked throughout the
cloth cover of the refrigerator until it is wholly wet. As
the water evaporates from the cover the air inside the
refrigerator is cooled.</p>

<p>The iceless refrigerator works well on days when
dry air is moving about. It does not do well on damp,
quiet days.</p>

<p>Another simple refrigerator which does very well for
a little milk or a pat of butter is a clean, earthen flower
pot, turned upside down in a shallow pan of water. This
will keep very cool the food which it covers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Kitchen Sink</b></div>

<p>Next to the stove, the sink is the most important piece
of kitchen furniture.</p>

<p>The best sinks are of enamel or are made of porcelain.
They have a fine wire drainer so that nothing
solid will go into the trap and plug the pipes. The Girl
Scout uses boiling water, and plenty of it, to flush the
sink. She takes pains that no grease gets into the drain
to harden there. When grease is accidentally collected,
soda and hot water will wash it away, but it should never
collect in the pipes.</p>

<p>The Keeper of the House takes pride in a perfectly
clean sink.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Taking Care of the House and the Things in It</b></div>

<p>Taking care of a house and its furniture means keeping
the house clean, neat, and orderly, and keeping every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>thing
in good repair. This means a great deal of thought
on the part of the Keeper of the House. For there are
many sorts of work to be done, and there is a right way
of doing every bit of it. By paying attention a Girl
Scout may learn very fast, and become very helpful and
competent.</p>

<p>First, there's the Dish Washing.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Dish Washing</b></div>

<p>In making ready for dish washing scrape every plate
carefully to remove crumbs that would get into the dish
water. Try using crumpled tissue paper to remove milk,
grease, or crumbs before the dishes are put into the pan.
Save tissue paper, and paper napkins for this.</p>

<p>Pile in separate piles, all dishes of each sort; wash
first glass, then silver, then cups, saucers, plates, then
the rest; do not put bone, ivory or wooden handles of
knives into the water. Use hot water and soap for dish
washing, then rinse with clean hot water.</p>

<p>Dish towels should be cleansed after every dish washing;
wash clean in hot soapy water, then rinse all the
soap away in clean water. Cooking utensils should soak
in cold water until time for dish washing, unless they
can be washed as soon as used.</p>

<p>Use a tray for carrying dishes to the closet or pantry
instead of travelling with a handful back and forth. Strain
the dish water before pouring it down the sink. Be sure
that no greasy water is put into the sink. Let the grease
rise and cool; skim it off and dispose of it after the
dishes are washed.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Taking Care of Rooms</b></div>

<p>Keeping a house in order means having everything in
its place in every room. It means sweet, fresh air in
every room; it means removal of dust and litter. A good
housekeeper "tidies" her rooms as she goes along, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
picking up anything that is out of place and putting it
where it belongs. But she also has a method in doing
things. Perhaps she sweeps the entire house every day
or every other day, or perhaps she puts one room in
order on one day and another on another and so on. The
important thing is to have a regular plan.</p>



<div class='center'><br /><b>The Living Room</b></div>

<p>Taking care of a living room means cleaning the floor
and the rugs; dusting the walls, the pictures; cleaning,
dusting, and sometimes polishing the furniture. Open
the windows top and bottom, dust and brush them inside
and out; use a soft brush or a dust mop to take the dust
from the floor. Use a carpet sweeper for the rugs unless
you have electricity and can use a vacuum cleaner; collect
the sweepings and burn them.</p>

<p>Dampen one quarter of your cheese-cloth duster and
roll it inside the rest of the duster, then wring. This
makes a dampish cloth for dusting the base-boards, window
sills, and other woodwork as well as the furniture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Where the furniture is highly polished, or would be injured
by water, use oil on the duster instead. Dust after
the dust has settled, not when it has been stirred into the
air. Shake and replace doilies or covers.</p>

<p>Be sure that the pictures hang straight after dusting
and that every piece of furniture is put in its right place.
See how long it takes to clean the room; then study to
find out how the time can be shortened.</p>

<p>Do not keep useless furniture nor have too many things
in your room.</p>

<p><i>The Bathroom</i> and the bath tub require daily cleansing.
In the ordinary family every one who uses the tub
should leave it perfectly clean for the next one who needs
it. All the furnishings of the bathroom should be kept
sweet and clean. Use a flush closet brush daily, scalding
it after using it. And remember that fresh air and sunshine
are cleansing agents. Get them to work for you.</p>

<p><i>The Bedroom.</i> Your bedroom needs all the fresh air
it can get. The Girl Scout sleeps with her windows
open. As soon as you have dressed in the morning throw
the windows wide open again, if they have been closed.
Open the bed, so that both sheets may be reached by
the fresh air. Shake up your pillows and put them on a
chair near the window. Leave your night clothing spread
or hung where it will be well aired. Let your room have
a fresh air bath!</p>

<p>You know already how to make a bed. You will remember
that all the bedclothing must be smooth and
even, when the bed is made. You are lucky if you have
a sister to help you make your bed, for this piece of work
is easier for two than for one. You will see that the
mattress is lying straight. Once a week you (the two of
you) will turn the mattress, end over end one week, and
side over side the next week. Then your mattress will
wear evenly, and not have a hollow in the middle where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
you sleep all the time. Then you two will lay the mattress
cover straight, and tuck it in firmly, so that you will
have no hard wrinkles to sleep on. The under sheet,
smooth and straight, must be tucked in all around. You
will make the bed as smooth as the table. Now the upper
sheet, which is the hardest thing to manage in bed making,
must be neatly tucked in at the foot. But you must allow
eight inches at the top to be turned over the blankets and
spread. Now the blankets, straight and smooth, and
evenly tucked in at the foot. Then you may choose between
tucking in the sides after folding the top sheet
down over the blankets, and afterwards covering the
whole bed with the spread, letting the sides and ends
hang down; and laying the spread even with the blankets,
tucking in the sides, and turning down the sheet over all.
Try both ways.</p>

<p>Now, shake and pat the pillows, making them very
smooth and quite square-cornered; then lay them or stand
them neatly at the head of the bed, meeting exactly in
the middle; and your bed is fit for a queen, or a tired
Girl Scout after a tramp!</p>

<p>With the bed neatly made, everything must be put in
its proper place. The furniture and window sills must
be dusted with a clean cheese-cloth duster; and the bare
floors must be nicely dusted with a dry floor-mop, or
a cloth pinned over a broom. If there are rugs, use
a carpet sweeper, if you have one, or a broom. If you
do any broom sweeping, however, you will do it before
you dust.</p>

<p>Now a last look to see that the room is tidy, every
chair in place and the shades even at the windows, and
your room is ready for the day. Of course any Girl
Scout who wants a Homemaker's badge will <i>do</i> all these
things;&mdash;not guess or suppose how others do them and
how long it takes. That is the honest way to learn. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
find out how long it takes to put your room in order.
There is only one way to find out.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Fighting Germs</b></div>

<p>Keeping clean in these days means keeping free from
troublesome germs as well as visible dirt. Germs thrive
in dampness and darkness. They can be overcome by
sunshine. For thorough cleanness, the house needs fresh
air and sunshine as well as sweeping and dusting. The
Girl Scout must remember to let the fresh air blow
through every room in the house every day. She should
sleep with her windows open. She is fortunate if she
can sleep out of doors.</p>

<p>Of course she is in honor bound to have no dark, damp,
hidden, dirt-filled corners in any part of her house, not
even in shed or cellar. Let in the light and clean out
the dirt.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Fighting the House Fly and Mosquito</b></div>

<p>House flies carry disease. They breed in filth, human
waste, animal droppings, decayed animal or vegetable
matter, and are so made that they carry filth wherever
they go. Since the fly alights wherever it pleases, it
carries dirt from outside and distributes it wherever it
CHOOSES.</p>

<p>Clean up all heaps of rubbish where flies may breed.
Keep your garbage pail <i>absolutely clean</i>. Disinfect outdoor
water-closets and cover with gravel or slacked lime.
Get fly traps to set on your porches. Kill all flies that
come into the house, especially the early ones, in the
spring. Keep your windows and doors screened.</p>

<p>Fight mosquitoes just as you fight flies. Leave no
still water even in an old tin can, for the eggs of mosquitoes
are deposited in still water and hatch there. The
mosquito, like many other insects, has an intermediate
stage between the egg and the grown mosquito. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
this stage it swims about in quiet water. Mosquitoes in
great numbers may be growing in old cans or bottles, rain-filled
and hidden away under the bushes in your yard.
Watch for such breeding places; clean up your yard and
banish the mosquito.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Taking Care of Waste</b></div>

<p>All waste must be carefully disposed of. It should
never accumulate in the kitchen; but the important thing
is to have <i>no real waste</i>. See that everything is put to
the utmost use. If you live in the country, chickens and
pigs will take the parings, the outer leaves of vegetables,
etc., and you can bury or burn waste. If you live in
the city the garbage man will collect all waste.</p>

<p>The garbage can must be kept thoroughly clean. It
should be rinsed and scalded whenever it is empty, so
that there will be no bad odors about the kitchen. Find
out how garbage is taken care of in your town. How
can you help to keep your neighborhood clean? What
should be done if there is carelessness about garbage?</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Taking Care of Woolen Things</b></div>

<p>Housekeepers must fight moths as well as flies. The
clothes moth loves to lay its eggs in wool. It is very
keen in searching out bits of wool and finding a place
for its baby to thrive. Unless you have a care it will
lay its eggs in your best winter dress which you forgot
and left hanging in the hot summer days.</p>

<p>When the baby worm pokes its head out of the egg,
it begins to feed upon the wool; and when some cold
winter morning you get your dress you will find holes
neatly cut where the little worm has gnawed, and beside
the holes the little woven cradle which the tiny
creature spun for itself, and in which the crawling worm
changed to the flying, silvery moth.</p>

<p>The housekeeper must therefore, carefully brush and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
pack away all woolen things before the moths arrive.
After the garment is cleansed and brushed it may be
folded in newspapers carefully pinned at the ends, so
that no crack is left for the moth to get in it, or it may be
laid in a cedar box; or in any plain box with moth balls
or camphor. Every box should be labelled so that you
know without opening it what is in it.</p>

<p>Watch edges of carpets and rugs for the carpet beetle
and the "Buffalo bug." The last bothersome creature
may eat your cotton dresses in your closet. All clothing
must have care.</p>

<p>Make a list of the woolen things that must be taken
care of if the house is closed in summer and what personal
clothing must be packed away for the summer
even if the house is not closed.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Storage of Food</b></div>

<p>Taking care of food so that it will "keep" well is just
as important as the careful buying of food. Much waste,
and therefore loss of money and labor, comes from
carelessness in the storage of food. The bright Girl
Scout will keep her eyes open to see how foods are taken
care of in the house; which foods must be kept in the
cellar; which ones must be stored on the shelves of dry
closets; which ones come in sealed parcels; which in
paper bags; which in boxes; which in barrels. There
must be a place in the house for keeping all these things.
So you need to think which foods <i>must</i> be kept in the
house and which must be bought from day to day. And
in the house which you plan there must be ample space for
closets and shelves, for keeping properly all that must
be stored. No one can say which things must be kept in
the house by every family. If the Girl Scout happens to
live in a crowded city where rents are high, she will have
little storage space, and will not keep so many things on
hand. If she lives in the country, miles from a store, she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
must have a "store" of her own. So keep your eyes open,
Girl Scout, and see what is being done in your part of
the world. That is what eyes are made for.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Heating the House</b></div>

<p>A house may be heated by a furnace, by stoves, or
even by open fires in the fireplace, as in old days. Heating
the house makes the chimney necessary. This must
be carefully arranged for in planning your house. Heating
by stoves is the most common arrangement. In the
large city or town, the furnace is used. This is merely
a big stove in the cellar or basement, so planned that its
heat is distributed through the house. By this means
one big stove does the work of many little ones, and
warms the whole house.</p>

<p>The furnace may use its heat to turn water into hot
steam, which is sent through all the house through the
iron pipes and radiators. Or the water in the boiler
may be made quite hot, though not turned into steam, and
sent through the house in the same way, by means of
pipes. Or hot air from around this big stove or furnace
may be sent through big pipes directly to the various
rooms. This means dust and dirt, and we are learning
to use steam and hot water instead of the hot air system.</p>

<p>The fireplace is almost a luxury. It is found oftenest
in country houses where wood can easily be got and
stored. The town or city home may have its open fire,
however. Everyone loves an open fire; and when you
plan your own house, you must manage to get one if
you can. The hearth is the heart of the house.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Labor Saving</b></div>

<p>The housekeeper must learn how to do her work in
the least possible time; she must save steps. Look at the
house that you have planned and see whether everything
you need to use is within easy reach. Look carefully at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the closets where you keep things. Are they big enough?
Are they in the right place? Suppose your water comes
from a well which is a long way from the house. What
difference will it make? What would you do about it?</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Water Supply</b></div>

<p>The water supply of every home should be carefully
guarded. If the water is defiled or contaminated by germs
of typhoid fever, diphtheria, or other diseases, whose bacteria
may be carried by water, the disease may be spread
wherever the water is used.</p>

<p>No earth closets or human or animal waste should be
in the neighborhood of the well. Water should come
from high ground and clean places with no possibility
of gathering infection on the way to the house. Great
pains should be taken to keep drinking water absolutely
clean. All drinking vessels should be washed and scalded
and the rims should never be handled.</p>

<p>In the country every home has a private water supply
and takes pains to guard it. In the city there is a common
water supply and everyone is responsible for keeping it
pure. Where does the water come from that supplies
your city or town? How is it kept clean? Who takes
care of it?</p>

<p>Whenever there is any question about the purity of
common drinking water, the table supply should be boiled,
for safety. Boiling will destroy any bacteria that could
produce disease. This boiled water should be used for
rinsing dishes as well as for drinking.</p>

<p>Girl Scouts will interest themselves in municipal or
neighborhood housekeeping, for that is a responsibility
which all share together.</p>

<p>Learning to take care of one's own home is a good
beginning, if one is to share in providing good conditions
for the neighborhood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Little Things Worth Remembering</b></div>

<p>The stove should be cleaned with crumpled newspaper
whenever the kitchen is put in order. All ashes should
be neatly brushed off.</p>

<p>In lifting ashes from the ash pan with a shovel use a
newspaper to cover the pail into which the ashes are
poured, so that the dust will not scatter over the room.
Don't dump them and raise dust; and never put hot ashes
into a wooden box or barrel.</p>

<p>Watch the floor of closets and see that no dusty corners
are hidden out of sight.</p>

<p>Air and dry soiled clothing before putting it in the
laundry basket. If damp clothes are hidden away they
will mildew.</p>

<p>Learn to make out a laundry list and to check it when
the laundry comes home.</p>

<p>Save the soap chips and use a soap shaker.</p>

<p>Get all the help you can from older housekeepers in
your neighborhood. Ask them how they do things and
why. Your mother may know something better than anybody
else does.</p>

<p>The Girl Scout asks questions and learns why things
are done as they are. She may think out a better way
some day, but first she must pay attention to the old
way.</p>

<p>Sing at your work; it goes better so. Besides, joy
belongs with housekeeping and your song helps to keep
her there. Always sing if the work drags, but let it be
a lively song!</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Making Things Clean and Keeping Clean</b></div>

<p>Making things clean is a most important duty of the
Keeper of the House. But don't forget, Girl Scout, that
keeping things clean is a constant duty. You know many
a body who "cleans up" with a lot of stir once in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
while, but who litters and spills and spreads dirt and lets
dust collect in corners all the rest of the time.</p>

<p>"Keeping clean" is the housekeeper's regular business,
and "cleaning up" never need stir up the whole house.</p>

<p>For keeping clean, soap and water must always be
had. The soap loves to wrestle with grease. The water
softens and rinses away both dirt and soap. You will
use a scouring soap or powder to clean stained or dirty
metal or glass; and you should cover water-closets and
other out-of-door places for refuse with clean slaked lime
now and then to keep them clean.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Ten Ways of Removing Stains</b></div>

<p>1. When you have <i>raspberry</i> or <i>blueberry</i> or <i>strawberry</i>
stains on your white handkerchief or blouse or
skirt, do not be too much disturbed. Hold the stained
part firmly over an empty bowl, with the spot well in
the centre, and ask some one to pour boiling hot water
over the spot and into the bowl. The stains will disappear
like magic. Then the wet spot may be dried and pressed
with a hot iron, and the damage is repaired.</p>

<p>2. <i>Peach</i> stains are much harder to remove, but they
should be treated just as the others were treated. Often
several applications of hot water are necessary for these
stubborn stains. But you must not lose patience. And
you must not use soap. The stain will fade out at last
under the hot water.</p>

<p>3. <i>Ink</i> stains are a great bother, especially to the
school girl who carries a leaky fountain pen. Do not let
them get dry. They will be much harder to remove.
Sometimes cold water, applied immediately, will remove
the ink, if the spot is rinsed carefully. Use the cold
water just as the hot water is used for the peach stain.
If that does not remove it try milk. If the milk fails,
let the spot soak in sour milk. Sometimes it must soak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a day or two; but it will disappear in the end, with rinsing
and a little rubbing.</p>

<p>4. <i>Ink</i> stains on a carpet are a serious matter. Let
us hope that no Girl Scout will be so unlucky as to upset
an ink bottle on a friend's carpet or rug. If she does,
she should know the best way to set about removing it.
This should be done as quickly as possible before the
ink dries, or "sets." Take cotton, or soft tissue paper or
blotting paper, and absorb all that has not soaked in. You
will see that the "sooner" <i>is</i> the "better" in this case.
Try not to increase the size of the spot, for you must keep
the ink from spreading. Then dip fresh cotton in milk,
and carefully sop the spot. Do not use the cotton when
it is inky; that will smear the carpet and spread the stain.
Use fresh bits of cotton, dipped in clean milk, until the
stain has disappeared. Then rinse with clean water in
the same way, and dry with dry cotton.</p>

<p>5. The <i>spots</i> made on silk or woolen by <i>acids</i> may be
removed by touching with ammonia or baking soda, dissolved
in a little water. The bright yellow spot on a
black dress will sometimes run away like lightning when
touched by the wet cork of the ammonia bottle.</p>

<p>6. <i>Egg stains</i> on the napkin, or sometimes, unfortunately,
on a dress front, must be removed before washing.
Use cold water alone. The egg will dissolve and can be
rinsed out. Hot water will cook the egg and it will be
hard to remove.</p>

<p>7. <i>Liquid shoe blacking</i> is almost worse than ink. It
must be treated in the same way, <i>and at once</i>.</p>

<p>8. <i>Coffee</i> and <i>tea stains</i> will wash out with either
warm water or soap and water. A black coffee stain on
a fresh tablecloth may be removed like the berry stains,
by the teakettle and bowl method.</p>

<p>9. <i>Grease spots</i> may be removed from washable
fabrics by soap and water. For silk and woolen, gaso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>line
should be used. Use gasoline in daytime only, to
avoid lamps or gas in the neighborhood; and <i>never</i> near
a fire. Use carbona instead of gasoline or benzine when
possible, as it cannot burn. Remember that all grease or
sugar spots should be removed before putting a woolen
garment away. Moths always seek them out, and they
will find them if you don't.</p>

<p>10. <i>Paint</i> can be removed by soaking the spot in turpentine.
This dissolves it, and a bit of rubbing shakes
it out. A brush helps, when the paint spot is on a woolen
garment, after the turpentine has done its work.</p>

<p><i>Remember</i>: All spots and stains should be removed
before washing the garment.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>GOOD MANNERS AND SOCIAL FORMS</b></div>

<p>It is easier to meet people socially if we are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aquainted'">acquainted</ins>
with the simple forms of introductions, meeting and parting,
and so forth. A girl who is entertaining her friends
will be more successful in doing so if she plans ahead
how she can welcome them and has all the necessary
preparations for a substantial good time, at hand. This
planning also makes it possible for her to be less occupied
when the time comes, and to have a good time herself.</p>

<p>Stand where guests can see you at once when they
enter.</p>

<p>Always introduce a younger person <i>to</i> an older one,
as "Mrs. Smith, may I present Miss Jones, or Mr.
Brown?" A man is always presented <i>to</i> a woman, or a
girl, as "Miss Brewster, may I present Mr. Duncan?"</p>

<p>If you have many guests, ask some of your friends to
join you in watching to be sure that no one is left out,
so that the evening may be a success for every one. It
is sometimes difficult for a hostess to do this alone.</p>

<p>If you ask other girls to help you ask each to do a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
definite thing, as to arrange for wraps, sing or play, pay
special attention to some older person, etc. This saves
confusion, as the Pine Tree patrol does in camp.</p>

<p>A few intimate friends need no plan to make them
have a good time, but with a large number it is usually
better to plan games, music, charades, or some other
form of entertainment.</p>

<p>When invited to a house at a certain time, be prompt.
Promptness is always a mark of courtesy, as it means
consideration for the time and convenience of others. One
should also watch carefully the time of leaving, and not
stay about unless specially detained.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>TABLE MANNERS</b></div>

<p>Accept what is offered or placed before you, with a
quiet "Thank you." If you are asked what you prefer,
it is proper to name it.</p>

<p>Do not drink while food is in the mouth.</p>

<p>Take soup quietly from the side of the spoon, dipping
it into the plate <i>from</i> instead of towards you, to avoid
dripping the soup.</p>

<p>Break bread or roll, and spread with butter only the
piece which you are about to eat.</p>

<p>Use knife only as a divider, the fork to take food to
the mouth. Where one can dispense with a knife, and
use only the fork to divide food, do so. When not
using either, lay them together across the side of the
plate, not resting on the table cloth.</p>

<p>A spoon should never be allowed to rest in a tall receptacle
such as a cup or glass, as it is likely to overturn
the receptacle. Place the spoon on plate or saucer.</p>

<p>At close of meal, fold napkin, that table may be left
in orderly condition. When napkins are to be washed
at once, or when they are paper napkins, they need not
be folded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Do not begin a course until all are served.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is better to serve the hostess first, and
sometimes it is the custom to serve the guest first, that is
the guest of honor who sits on the hostess' right. When
the host or hostess does the serving, the guest is served
first.</p>

<p>Do not be troubled if you use the wrong spoon or fork,
and never call attention to anyone else's doing so. No
matter how you feel, or what the blunder or accident may
be, such as spilling something or dropping a plate, never
show displeasure to either servant or guest. Good <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'breding'">breeding</ins>
and pleasant atmosphere are essential to all entertainment.</p>

<p>Good breeding means first of all thoughtfulness of
others, and nothing shows lack of breeding so quickly as
a lack of such politeness to those who happen to be
serving us in hotels, at home, in shops, or when travelling,
or anywhere else.</p>

<p>When acting as waitress, stand at the left of the person
to be served, so that the portion may be taken with
the right hand.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Preparing the Meal</b></div>

<p>Plan the cooking so that the food that is to be served
may be kept hot; for instance, soup may be kept hot on
the back of the stove or where there is less heat, while the
meat or vegetables are being cooked. Food that is to be
served cold, should be kept in the ice-box or standing in
water until the last moment and served in chilled dishes.
In placing the food on the dishes and platters care should
be taken to make it look attractive.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Setting the Table</b></div>

<p>When setting the table keep in mind how many courses
there will be, and therefore, how many knives, forks, and
spoons are needed. Have everything clean, and lay every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>thing
straight. Air room well. Wipe table, and if a
tablecloth is used, cover table with a felt silence cloth.
If a tablecloth is used, it should be laid with the fold
in the center of the table. If a centerpiece and doilies
are used, they should be laid at even distances. Clean
white oil cloth and paper napkins make an attractive
looking table. At each cover the knife, edge in, is placed
at the right with the spoon, and the glass is placed at
the right in line with the end of the knife. The fork is
at the left and bread and butter plate and small knife
are at the left opposite the glass. Put the napkin between
the knife and fork.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i021.png" width="425" height="309" alt="Set Table" title="" />
</div>

<p>Salt, pepper, water, bread and butter should be on the
table, and if necessary, vinegar, mustard, sugar, pickles,
etc.</p>

<p>When possible a few flowers add to the appearance of
the table.</p>

<p>Have as much ready as possible before sitting down
at the table. See at least that (1), glasses are filled;
(2), butter portioned; (3), chairs placed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Hard and fast rules as to table setting do not exist.
Local customs, the amount of service at hand, and common
sense must govern this. The captain, assisted by
the council, must be the judges.</p>


<h3><br />THE GIRL SCOUT COOK</h3>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">By Ula M. Dow, A. M.</span><br />

<i>In charge of Division of Food, Simmons College</i></div>

<p>The Girl Scout who has earned the Cooking Badge
may be a great help at home if she has learned to work
quickly and neatly and may get much amusement both
at home and on camping parties. If the first trial of a
process is not a success, the Scout should have patience
to try again and again until her result is satisfactory.
If she has learned to prepare a few simple dishes well
she should have courage to try unfamiliar recipes which
are found in any good cook book. If she is to be ready
to take responsibility when it is necessary, she should
be able to plan the meals in such a way that nothing is
wasted and that the family is satisfied and well-nourished.</p>

<p>When working in the kitchen the Scout should wear
a clean, washable dress, or a washable apron which covers
her dress. She should be sure that her hair is tidy,
and she should remember to wash her hands before beginning
work. She should try to use as few dishes as
possible and not to spill or spatter. She should remember
that her cooking is not finished until she has
cleaned up after herself, has washed and put away the
dishes, washed the dish towels and left the kitchen in
order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What to Have for Breakfast</span>&mdash;Breakfast is in most
families the simplest meal of the day and the easiest
to prepare. Some people are satisfied with fruit, cereal,
toast or muffins, coffee for the adults, and milk for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
children. Many families, however, like the addition of
a heartier dish, such as boiled or poached eggs, fish hash,
or minced meat on toast. If a hearty dish is served at
breakfast this is a good time to use up such left-overs
as potato, fish, or meat.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Simple Breakfast</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Apple sauce or sliced peaches.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oatmeal or cornmeal mush.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toast or muffins.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coffee (for adults).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Milk (for children).</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Hearty Breakfast</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Coffee (for adults).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Milk (for children).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poached eggs or minced lamb on toast.</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fruit</span>&mdash;Raw fruit should be carefully washed and
prepared in such a way that it can be easily eaten. Berries
may be cooked with no other preparation than washing.
Fruits, such as apples and pears, should be washed,
pared, quartered, and cored before cooking. Any fruit
which becomes dark on standing after it is cut may be
kept light colored by dropping the pieces into a pan of
water until they are ready to be cooked. If this is done
most of the water should be drained off before they are
cooked.</p>

<p>Dried fruits, such as prunes, which have a wrinkled
skin should be soaked for a short time in cold water
before they are washed. Otherwise it is impossible to
get them clean. After washing they should be covered
with cold water and soaked over night, or until they are
plump. They should be put on to cook in the water in
which they are soaked and cooked until tender. Sugar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
should then be added if they are not sweet enough.</p>

<p>The most common method of cooking fresh fruit is
to boil it gently with just enough water to prevent it
from burning. Sugar should be added just before the
cooking is finished, the amount depending on the acidity
of the fruit and the taste of the family.</p>

<p>In sampling food, the cook should remember that the
rest of the food is to be eaten by other people. She
should never taste from the cooking spoon, but should
transfer her sample to a tasting spoon which is not returned
to the kettle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cereal</span>&mdash;Cereals, such as oatmeal, cornmeal, and
cracked wheat, should be cooked in a double boiler. A
double boiler can be improvised by setting a pail or pan
into a kettle of boiling water. Cereals for breakfast
may be cooked the day before and reheated in the
double boiler, but should not be stirred while reheating.
A tablespoonful or two of cold water on top will prevent
a hard skin from forming while standing. All
prepared cereals are better if cooked for a longer time
than the package directions indicate. It is hardly possible
to cook any grain too long. The fireless cooker is
especially valuable for cooking cereals, but a longer
period of time must be allowed than for cooking in a
double boiler. A home-made fireless cooker, described
in another place, is interesting to make. Ready-to-serve
cereals are very expensive compared with those cooked
at home.</p>

<p>Cracked wheat, 1/4 cup to 1 cup water; 3-12 hours.</p>

<p>Rolled oats, 1/2 cup to 1 cup water; 1/2-3 hours</p>

<p>Cornmeal, 3 tablespoonfuls to 1 cup water; 1-4 hours.</p>

<p>Use 1/2 teaspoonful of salt to each quart of water.
Have the water boiling rapidly. Add the cereal gradually.
Let the mixture cook directly over the fire 5 minutes.
Place over boiling water or in the fireless cooker to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
cook slowly for a long time. Keep covered and do not
stir. The time of cooking given in the table means
that the cereal is eatable after the shorter time mentioned,
but is better if cooked the longer time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toast</span>&mdash;Good toast is worth knowing how to make.
The cook should not be satisfied with toast which is either
white or burned.</p>

<p>Toast is most easily made from stale bread, which
should be cut in one-third to one-half inch slices. A
single slice of toast may be made by holding it over
the fire on a fork. In camp a forked stick answers
every purpose. The easiest way to make several slices
is to put them in a wire toaster and hold them over hot
coals. Begin carefully and hold the bread some distance
away from the fire, turning it often until it dries.
Then hold it nearer the coals until it a golden brown on
both sides. With a new coal fire or wood fire toast
must be made on a toaster on the top of the stove to
prevent the bread from being smoked. If the top of
the stove is being used for other things, the drying may
be done in the oven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffins</span>&mdash;Any good cook book has numerous recipes
for muffins, most of which, can be made easily if the
directions are followed exactly.</p>

<p>Cornmeal Muffins (for four persons):</p>

<p>Four tablespoonfuls butter or oleomargarine, 3 tablespoonfuls
sugar, 1 egg, 1 cup milk, 1-1/3 cups flour, 2/3
cup cornmeal, 3 teaspoonfuls baking powder.</p>

<p>Cream the butter, add the sugar and the egg well
beaten. Sift the baking powder with the flour and cornmeal
and add to the first mixture, alternating with milk.
Bake in buttered muffin pan 25 to 30 minutes. This
mixture makes good corn bread if baked in a shallow
buttered pan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coffee</span>&mdash;If the family drink coffee, they will want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
coffee for breakfast no matter what other items of the
menu may be varied. It should be served only to the
grown-up members of the family. Coffee of average
strength is made as follows:</p>

<p>One-half cup coffee finely ground, 4 cups cold water,
2 eggshells.</p>

<p>Mix the coffee, the crushed eggshell, and 1/2 cupful
of cold water in a scalded coffee pot. Add the remainder
of the water and allow the mixture to come gradually
to the boiling point. Boil 3 minutes. Draw to the
back of the range and keep hot for 5 minutes. Add
1/8 cupful of cold water and let stand 1 minute to settle.
Strain into a heated coffee pot in which the coffee is
to be served at the table.</p>

<p>A method for making coffee used by the guides in
the White Mountains is as follows:</p>

<p>Boil the water in an ordinary pail, remove the pail
from the fire, pour the dry coffee gently on the top of
the water, cover tightly and move it near the fire where
it will keep warm but will not boil again. In about
thirty minutes the coffee will have become moistened
and sunk to the bottom of the pail. If the coffee is slow
in becoming moist, time may be saved by removing the
cover for a moment and pressing gently with a spoon
on the top of the coffee, but the mixture must not be
stirred. It is essential that the water be boiling when
the coffee is added, that the cover be absolutely tight,
and that the coffee be kept hot without boiling. Half
a cup of coffee to four cups of water makes coffee of
average strength.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Milk</span>&mdash;The little children of the family should have
whole milk at every meal. The older children should
have milk at breakfast and supper time. There is no
food so good for children who want to be well and strong.
A part of the family supply of milk is sometimes skimmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to give cream for use in coffee and on desserts. The
cream contains most of the fat in the milk, but the
skimmed milk which is left is still a very valuable food,
containing the substances which make muscle and bone,
and every bit of it should be used in the cooking or for
making cottage cheese. The waste of milk is the worst
possible extravagance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eggs</span>&mdash;Eggs may be prepared in countless ways, and
the ambitious cook will find much amusement in trying
some of the suggestions in the cook books. Eggs are
an entirely satisfactory substitute for meat and fish,
and are therefore often served for the main dish at
dinner or supper. Many people like an egg every morning
for breakfast, but this is a rather extravagant
habit. If eggs are served for breakfast they are usually
cooked in the shell, poached or scrambled. The men of
the family sometimes prefer their eggs fried, but this is
not a good method for the children. Only fresh eggs
can be poached successfully, so that this is a good test
for freshness.</p>

<p><i>Poached Eggs</i>&mdash;Oil the skillet and fill it to within a half
inch of the top with water. Break each egg into a saucer
and let the water boil after the egg is placed in it. The
egg is done when the white is jelly-like and a slight film
is formed over the yolk. Remove the egg with a griddle
cake turner to a piece of buttered toast. Sprinkle lightly
with salt. If the eggs are not absolutely fresh, the
white will scatter in the water. If the first egg to be
cooked shows this tendency oiled muffin rings may be
put in the pan to keep the rest of them in shape.</p>

<p><i>Soft Boiled Eggs</i>&mdash;A soft boiled egg has much the
same consistency as a poached egg. It is easier to manage
because the shell is unbroken, but it is harder to get
it of just the right consistency because the contents of
the egg are invisible. Most people are very particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to have the egg just hard or soft enough to suit them,
and it is necessary for the cook to practice to be sure
of uniform results. Drop the eggs carefully into a kettle
of boiling water, draw the kettle back on the stove so
that the water does not boil again and (for a soft egg)
allow the eggs to remain for five minutes. If the eggs
are very cold they should remain longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Use of Left-overs for Breakfast</span>&mdash;If the family
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'like'">likes</ins> a hearty breakfast this is a good meal at which to
use bits of left-over meat which might otherwise be
wasted. Meat may be chopped or ground, reheated in
the gravy which was served with it, and served on toast.
Lamb is especially good minced on toast. To make hash
mix equal quantities of meat and chopped potato and
brown nicely in a greased frying pan. Such mixtures
should be tasted to make sure that they are <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'salt'">salted</ins> enough.
Some people like a very small amount of onion with any
of these made-over meat dishes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>DINNER</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">What to Have for Dinner</span>&mdash;If all the members of
the family are at home at noontime it is usually more
convenient to have dinner then, but if members of the
family are away or hurried at noontime it may be better
to have dinner at night. Dinner may consist of several
courses, but if the mother or the daughter of the
family prepares the meal, the family is usually perfectly
satisfied with two courses.</p>

<p>The main course of a simple family dinner consists
of meat, fish, eggs or a cheese dish served with potato,
rice or macaroni, and a vegetable such as string beans,
green peas, carrots, cabbage, tomatoes or corn. If the
family <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'like'">likes</ins> salad, the vegetables are often served as a
salad. This is a very good way to use up small amounts
of vegetables which are left from the day before. Often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
little remainders of two or more vegetables may be very
attractively combined in this way.</p>

<p>Some families like hot bread at dinner, and hot breads,
such as baking powder biscuit (described under supper),
or corn bread (described under breakfast), are particularly
good with some combinations. Examples are baking
powder biscuit with meat stew or fricasseed chicken and
corn bread with bacon and eggs or ham. If fish is served
in a chowder, buttered and toasted crackers are usually
served. An occasional chowder for dinner is an excellent
way to use up any surplus of skimmed milk which may
be on hand.</p>

<p>The kind of dessert served at dinner, besides depending
on the taste of the family, depends on the amount
of money which is spent for food and whether there
are young children in the family. Pie and ice cream,
which are favorite desserts in many families, are expensive.
Little children should not have desserts which
contain a good deal of fat, such as pie or doughnuts, or
which are the least <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'big'">bit</ins> soggy, as some steamed puddings
are inclined to be. The most economical desserts and
those best suited to the children are baked puddings
made with milk and cereal, such as Indian pudding,
rice pudding, and those made with cereal and fruit,
such as Apple Betty or peach tapioca. If there is
skimmed milk on hand the possibility of using it in a
milk pudding should be considered. Chocolate bread
pudding and Apple Betty made a very attractive use
of left-over bread. Dessert should always be chosen
with reference to the heartiness of the first course. A
main dish which is not very filling can be balanced by
a more substantial dessert.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meat</span>&mdash;The best way to learn about cuts of meat is
to go often to market and talk to the butcher whenever
he has a minute to spare. Some cuts of meat are tough
with coarse fibers and much connective tissue. They
should be ground if, like Hamburg steak, they are to
be cooked by a short process, such as broiling. If not
ground, the tougher meats are usually cooked a long
time with water and made into a stew, a pot roast, a
meat pie, or a meat loaf. These cuts are cheaper, but
require more care in preparation than the more expensive
cuts. Examples are the bottom of the round, the
shin, and the flank of beef. The more expensive cuts,
such as the top of the round, tenderloin and sirloin, are
more tender, more delicately flavored, and are used for
broiling and roasting. Some cuts which seem inexpensive
really cost more than they appear to because they
contain large amounts of bone or waste fat. The difference
between lamb and mutton is a question of the
age at which the animal was slaughtered. Lamb is much
more tender than mutton, is more delicately flavored
and more expensive. There is a similar difference between
chicken and fowl. Fowl is much tougher than
chicken and requires careful and long cooking to make
it tender.</p>

<p><i>Pan Broiled Hamburg Steak</i>&mdash;Hamburg steak may
be bought already ground at the butcher's, or one of
the cheap cuts of beef, such as bottom of the round or
shin, may be bought and ground at home. Many people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
like a little salt pork or onion ground with the meat.</p>

<p>Make the meat into small, flat cakes and cook in a
smoking hot frying pan which has been thoroughly
rubbed over with a piece of fat. When one side is
seared over nicely turn the cakes (a griddle cake turner
or spatula is helpful) and broil on the other side. Place
on a hot platter, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dot
with bits of butter and garnish with a little parsley or
watercress.</p>

<p>A rump or sirloin steak may be broiled in a hot frying
pan in a similar way. Wipe and trim the steak, place
in a smoking hot frying pan and sear both sides. Reduce
the heat and turn the steak occasionally (about
every 2 minutes) until it is cooked, allowing 8 minutes
for a rare steak, 10 minutes for medium cooked steak,
and 12 minutes for well done steak, for a steak 1 inch
thick. Avoid puncturing the meat with a fork while
cooking.</p>

<p>Many people prefer to broil a steak on a broiler. This
is practical with gas or electricity or over a wood or
coal fire which is reduced to clear coals without smoke
or flame. It is very difficult indeed to cook Hamburg
steak on a broiler.</p>

<p>Lamb chops may be broiled in either way.</p>

<p><i>Roast Leg of Lamb</i>&mdash;Wash the leg of lamb, place it
on the rack in a roasting pan and put in a hot oven
with the roaster uncovered. When the roast is well
seared (15 to 30 minutes), draw from the oven, sprinkle
with salt, pour a little water into the pan, and put on
the cover. Finish cooking at a lowered temperature,
allowing 20 or 25 minutes for each pound.</p>

<p>A dripping pan may be used in place of a roaster,
using a pan of similar size for a cover. A rack may
be improvised from a broiler, a toaster or a cake rack.</p>

<p>Beef is roasted in the same way, but is usually cooked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
for a shorter time (15 to 20 minutes for each pound).</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Beef Stew</span> (for four):<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></small> pounds beef shoulder or shin.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2 cups diced potato.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> cup turnip cut in half inch cubes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> cup carrot cut in half inch cubes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></small> onion chopped.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">2 tablespoons flour.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Salt and pepper.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Wash the meat, remove from the bone and fat and
cut in 1-1/2 inch cubes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper
and dredge with flour. Sear the pieces of meat in the
frying pan in the fat cooked out from the trimmings
of fat. Put the meat in a kettle, and rinse the frying
pan with boiling water, so that none of the juices will
be lost. Add the bone, cover with boiling water and
boil five minutes. Lower the temperature and cook until
the meat is tender (about three hours). Add the
carrots, turnips, onions, pepper and salt in an hour, and
the potato in 15 minutes before the steak is to be served.
Remove the bone and any large pieces of fat. Stir
two tablespoons of flour to a smooth paste with a little
water and thicken the stew.</p>

<p>Such a stew may also be made with lamb, mutton, or
veal, using other vegetables as desired. Celery and onion
are better than turnip and carrot with veal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chicken</span>&mdash;If a chicken is purchased at the market
it is usually delivered dressed. This means that the head
has been cut off, the entrails removed, and the coarser
pinfeathers pulled out. Many times, however, it is necessary
to know how to do this oneself.</p>

<p><i>To Dress and Clean a Chicken</i>&mdash;Cut off the head and
draw out the pinfeathers. Remove hair and down by
holding the fowl over a flame (a gas flame, an alcohol
flame, or a piece of paper flaming in the wood or coal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
range), constantly changing the position until all parts
of the surface have been exposed to the flame. Cut
off the feet. Wash the fowl thoroughly, using a small
brush, in water to which a little soda has been added.
Rinse and dry. Make a slit down the back of the neck.
Remove the crop and windpipe. Draw down the neck
skin long enough to fasten under the back. Make a
straight cut from 1/2 inch below the tip of the breastbone
to the vent. Cut around the vent. Slip fingers
in carefully around and fully loosen the entrails. Carefully
draw out the entrails. The lungs, lying in the
cavities under the breast, and the kidneys, in the hollow
near the end of the backbone, must be taken out
separately. Remove the oil sack and wash the chicken
by allowing cold water to run through it.</p>

<p>To clean giblets (the gizzard, the heart, and the liver)
proceed as follows: Separate the gall bladder from
the liver, cutting off any portion of the liver that may
have a greenish tinge. Remove the thin membrane, the
arteries, the veins and the clotted blood around the
heart. Cut the fat and the membranes from the gizzard.
Make a gash through the thickest part of the
gizzard as far as the inner lining, being careful not to
pierce it. Remove the inner sack and discard. Wash
the gizzard carefully and boil in water to use for giblet
sauce.</p>

<p>If the chicken comes from the market dressed it should
be washed carefully and any pinfeathers removed which
were overlooked by the market man.</p>

<p><i>To Stuff, Truss and Roast a Chicken</i>&mdash;When the
chicken is clean and prepared as directed, fill it with
stuffing (described later), a little in the opening at the
neck, the rest in the body cavity. Sew up the opening
with a few long stitches. Draw the skin of the neck
smoothly down and under the back, press the wings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
close against the body and fold the pinions under, so
that they will cross the back and hold down the skin
of the neck. Press the legs close to the body. Thread
the trussing needle with white twine, using it double.
Press the needle through the wing at the middle joint,
pass it through the skin of the neck and back,
and out again at the middle joint of the other wing.
Return the needle through the bend of the leg at the
second joint, through the body, and out at the same
point on the other side; draw the cord tight and tie it
with the end at the wing joint. Thread the needle
again and run it through the legs and body at the thigh
bone and back at the ends of the drumsticks. Draw
the drumstick bones close together, covering the opening
made for drawing the chicken and tie the ends. Have
both knots on the same side of the chicken. When cooked,
cut the cord on the opposite side and draw out by the
knots.</p>

<p>Lay the stuffed and trussed chicken on its back on
a rack in a roasting pan. Lay a strip of salt pork on
breast. Place in a hot oven until the chicken begins
to brown, then lower the temperature and cook the
chicken until very tender. Baste often with the drippings
in the pan. From 3 to 4 hours will be required
for a five-pound chicken. If a fowl is used it should
be steamed for 3 or 4 hours and then roasted for 1/2
hour.</p>

<p><i>Stuffing</i>&mdash;For a large chicken mix thoroughly 4 cups
of finely broken stale bread, 1-1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/8
teaspoon of pepper, 1 teaspoon of poultry dressing and
4 tablespoons of fat. Pour over the mixture hot milk
or water, stirring lightly until the mixture is moist.</p>

<p><i>Giblet Gravy</i>&mdash;If the chicken was properly roasted
the drippings in the pan should be nicely browned, but
not burned. Make a gravy from these drippings and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the water in which the giblets were boiled. To do this
pour the water into the pan, set the pan over the fire
and stir until the contents of the pan are dissolved.
Thicken with a smooth paste of flour and water, using
two tablespoons of flour for every cup of liquid. Boil
until the flour tastes cooked. Strain. Add the giblets
cut in small pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetables</span>&mdash;All vegetables should be clean, crisp
and firm when ready for cooking. Vegetables are prepared
and cooked in a variety of ways, but almost all
vegetables should be <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'carefuly'">carefully</ins> washed as the first
process. It is convenient to keep a small brush for
washing the vegetables, like potatoes, sweet potatoes,
and beets, which must be scrubbed to get them clean.
Vegetables which are to be eaten raw, such as lettuce
and celery, should be washed with special care, wrapped
in a clean, wet cloth and put in the ice box to keep them
crisp.</p>

<p><i>Baked Potato</i>&mdash;Select smooth potatoes of even size.
Scrub them carefully and bake them in a hot oven. The
time required is from 45 to 60 minutes, depending on
the size of the potatoes and the temperature of the oven.
When the potatoes are done, slash each one with a knife
to let the steam escape, and serve immediately.</p>

<p><i>Mashed Potato</i>&mdash;Wash the potatoes, pare, cover with
boiling salted water (1 level teaspoon of salt to a pint
of water), and cook until tender (30 to 45 minutes).
Drain off the water and return to the fire a moment to
dry. Mash the potatoes, add butter, salt, pepper and
hot milk, and beat vigorously until light and creamy.
For three cups of potato use 2 tablespoons of butter
and 4 tablespoons of hot milk. Pile lightly in a hot
dish and serve immediately.</p>

<p><i>Steamed Squash</i>&mdash;Wash and cut in one-inch slices.
Steam until tender, scrape from the shell, mash thor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>oughly,
season with salt, pepper and butter, and serve.</p>

<p><i>String Beans</i>&mdash;Snap the ends from the beans, remove
any strings, cut into short pieces, wash, cover with boiling
salted water (1 level teaspoon to a pint) and cook
until tender. The time required will vary from one
hour to three hours, depending on the age and kind of
bean. Drain the beans, season with salt and butter,
and serve.</p>

<p>Canned string beans should be rinsed, reheated in as
little water as possible, drained, and seasoned.</p>

<p><i>Baked Tomatoes</i>&mdash;Select smooth tomatoes of even
size. Wash the tomatoes, cut a thin slice from
the stem end and remove a spoonful of pulp. Sprinkle
with salt, pepper and scraped onion, fill the cavity with
buttered crumbs, place in a pan (preferably one which
can be used as a serving dish at the table), and bake in
a moderate oven until the tomatoes are tender. Serve
in the dish in which they were cooked or remove them
carefully to the platter on which the Hamburg steak
is being served, arranging them in a ring around the
meat.</p>

<p>The buttered crumbs are prepared by melting a tablespoon
of butter or oleomargarine and stirring in six
tablespoonfuls of dry bread crumbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Desserts</span>&mdash;Most desserts are easy to make if the
directions given in the cook books are followed exactly.
Many people take pride in making delicious cake or
pie, who are careless about making good toast or baking
a potato well.</p>

<p><i>Apple Betty</i>&mdash;Prepare well-sweetened apple sauce
and thin slices of lightly buttered bread cut in small
triangles. Fill a shallow baking dish with alternate
layers of apple sauce and toast, beginning with apple
sauce and ending with toast. Sprinkle lightly with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
sugar and cinnamon and heat in the oven. Serve with
cream.</p>

<p><i>Orange Jelly</i>&mdash;Swell 1-1/2 tablespoons of powdered
gelatin in half cupful of cold water. Mix 1 cupful
of orange juice, 1/4 cupful of lemon juice, 1/2 cupful of
sugar and 1-1/4 cupfuls of boiling water. Add the gelatin
and stir carefully until it is dissolved. Strain into
a wet mould and chill until the jelly is firm. Unmould
the jelly and serve with whipped cream or a custard
sauce. To unmould the jelly, run the point of a knife
around the edge of the mould, dip the mould quickly
in warm water, place an inverted serving plate on top
of the mould, turn both over and lift the mould carefully.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SUPPER OR LUNCH</b></div>

<p><span class="smcap">What To Have for Supper.</span>&mdash;Supper shows more
variation between families than other meals of the day.
Some men insist upon meat, even though meat is served
for their dinner, but this is rather extravagant unless
there is left-over meat which should be used. Hash and
minced lamb on toast, which were suggested for the
hearty breakfast, would be equally well liked by most
families for supper. Many families prefer for supper
some milk dish such as macaroni and cheese or a cream
soup served with either stewed or fresh fruit or followed
by a fruit or vegetable salad. Hot rolls or baking powder
biscuits are a very attractive substitute for plain bread
if someone has time to make them at the last minute. If
the mother and daughter do all the work of the family,
they usually like to have on hand cookies or cake, which
can be used for supper rather than to have to prepare
some special dessert. Cold meat has the advantage that
it is ready to serve with little preparation, but many
other dishes such as the macaroni and cheese and the
creamed soup, suggested in the menus, may be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
when dinner is being prepared and simply reheated for
supper.</p>

<p>A hot drink at night usually seems desirable except on
hot days in the summer. If tea is served for adults, the
children should have cocoa or milk.</p>

<p>If dinner is served at night, luncheon is served in the
middle of the day. The suggestions made in regard to
supper apply equally well to luncheon.</p>

<p>Little children should have their hearty meal in the
middle of the day and a light meal at night no matter
what arrangement of meals the rest of the family may
have.</p>

</table></div>
<p><i>Macaroni and Cheese.</i>&mdash;For macaroni and cheese the
macaroni must be cooked and white sauce prepared.
Break three-quarters of a cup of macaroni in inch pieces
and cook in two quarts of boiling water to which a tablespoon
of salt has been added. The water must be boiling
rapidly when the macaroni is added and must be kept
boiling constantly. When the macaroni is tender, drain
it in a strainer and run enough cold water through it to
prevent the pieces from sticking together. To prepare
the sauce, melt two tablespoons of butter or oleomargarine
in the top of a double boiler, stir in two tablespoons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of flour and a half teaspoon of salt and pour over the
mixture a cup and a half of cold milk. Cook this mixture
directly over the heat, stirring constantly until it
begins to thicken. Then place the dish over the lower
part of the double boiler, containing boiling water, and
let it continue cooking for fifteen minutes. Put a layer
of the boiled macaroni in a buttered baking dish and
sprinkle with cheese, either grated or cut into small
pieces. Pour on a layer of the sauce. Follow this by
layers of macaroni, cheese and sauce until the dish is
full. Cover with buttered crumbs and bake until the
crumbs are brown. To make the buttered crumbs, melt
one tablespoon of butter or oleomargarine and stir in six
tablespoons of crumbs.</p>

<p>The macaroni and cheese may be prepared in the morning
if desired and baked at supper time in a moderate
oven. It should be left in the oven long enough to become
thoroughly hot. If there are little children in the
family a dish of creamed macaroni should be made for
them without the cheese.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><i>Cream of Potato Soup</i>&mdash;</div>


<div class='poem'>
3 potatoes<br />
1 quart milk<br />
2 slices of onion<br />
3 tablespoons flour<br />
1<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></small> teaspoons salt<br />
<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub></small> teaspoon celery salt<br />
<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small> teaspoon pepper<br />
2 tbsp. butter or oleomargarine<br />
</div>

<p>Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water. When soft
rub through a sieve. Scald the milk with the onion in a
double boiler, remove the onion, unless the family likes it
left in, add the salt, celery salt and pepper. Melt the
butter in a small sauce pan, stir the flour into it and then
add this mixture to the hot milk, stirring briskly. Cook
for ten minutes over boiling water in the double boiler.</p>

<p>A good creamed soup may be made from almost any
vegetable, substituting vegetable pulp for the potato.
Celery soup and corn soup are very good. With these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and most other vegetables, the celery salt should be
omitted. Onion salt is very useful.</p>

<p>Creamed soups are very good made from skimmed
milk if there is a supply in the house which should be
used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salad</span>&mdash;The pleasure in a salad is in its crispness, attractiveness
or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'arangement'">arrangement</ins>, and pleasant combination of
flavors. A salad may be arranged in a large dish and
served at the table if it is the chief dish of the meal, such
as chicken salad or fish salad, but it is usually arranged
in individual portions and made to look as dainty and
pretty as possible. All fresh vegetables and fruits used
should be crisp and cold and thoroughly washed. Canned
or leftover vegetables or fruit may often be used.</p>

<p><i>To wash lettuce.</i>&mdash;Handle delicately. Remove leaf by
leaf from the stalk, examining for insects. Pass the
leaves backwards and forwards through clean water until
all sand is removed. Fold in a wet cloth and keep in
the ice-box until it is used. The lettuce leaves should be
dried when they are used.</p>

<p><i>French Dressing.</i>&mdash;Mix 3/4 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon
of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of paprika. Add oil and
vinegar alternately, beating constantly with a fork until
5 tablespoons of vinegar and 10 tablespoons of oil have
been used. A quick way to make French dressing is to
mix all the ingredients in a bottle with a tightly fitting
stopper and shake vigorously until the ingredients are
blended. Some persons prefer less vinegar, and reduce
the amount to 2-1/2 tablespoons vinegar to 10 of oil.</p>

<p>Have the ingredients chilled, Place the mixing bowl
in crushed ice. Mix the egg yolk, mustard, salt and
cayenne pepper. Add a few drops of vinegar or lemon
juice, then a teaspoon of oil, drop by drop, until all the
ingredients are used. Constant beating is necessary
throughout.</p>

<p><i>Fruit and Vegetable Salads.</i>&mdash;Good combinations for
salad are (1) potato and beet, (2) carrot and green peas,
(3) tomato and celery, (4) asparagus and pimento. Combinations
of fruit and vegetables are, (1) apple and
celery, (2) orange and green pepper. Combinations of
different kinds of fruit and nuts or cheese are especially
good. Examples are, (1) pineapple and orange, (2)
white cherries stuffed with nuts, (3) banana rolled in
chopped nuts or (4) half pears (cooked or raw) with a
ball of cream cheese and chopped nuts in the cavity made
by the removal of the core.</p>

<p>Magazines which devote a page to cooking usually have
in their summer numbers pictures of salads from which

<p>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt, twice. Put in
the shortening, then add the milk gradually, mixing with
a knife. The dough should be as soft as can be handled
without sticking. Turn onto a lightly floured board, roll
lightly 3/4 inch thick and cut with a floured cutter. Bake
in a hot oven 12 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p><i>Tea.</i>&mdash;People who like tea have very decided ideas
about how strong is should be and how long it should be
steeped. The following gives tea of moderate strength.</p>

<p>Scald the teapot and put in 4 teaspoonfuls of tea
leaves. Pour over them four cups of boiling water, cover
and steep 3 minutes. Strain into a teapot and serve at
once.</p>

<p><i>Cocoa.</i>&mdash;The children of the family should never have
tea. On a cold night cocoa is a very pleasant variant
from the usual glass of milk.</p>

<p>Mix 4 tablespoons of cocoa with 3 tablespoons of sugar
and a little salt. Add 1 cup of boiling water and
cook until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add a
quart of milk and heat to boiling. This may be done
more safely in a double boiler. Just before serving beat
with an egg beater.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>General Suggestions</b></div>

<p>If the Girl Scout who is preparing for her examination
will look back over the menus which have
been suggested, she will notice that milk is emphasized.
It is absolutely essential that the children in the family
shall have milk. If the family do not like milk to drink,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
it should be remembered that every bit which is used in
cooking serves the same purpose as if it were taken from
a glass, but little children do not ordinarily get enough
milk unless they drink some. Fruit should be served at
least once a day and better twice, and some vegetable
other than potato should be not only served but eaten
by the family. Children who are not taught to like vegetables
when they are little sometimes never learn to like
them, and it is really important to eat vegetables, not only
because they contain important substances for growth,
but because it is only good manners to learn to like all
the ordinary foods which are served. Anyone who has
cooked knows how discouraging it is to feel that some
member of the family does not like the food. There is
a temptation in the city where fruit, vegetables and milk
are high, to use too much meat and but little of these
foods. It has been suggested recently that in forming
an idea as to whether the money is being spent to the
most advantage, the money spent for fruit and vegetables,
for milk and cheese, and for meat and fish should be
compared. In a well-balanced diet these amounts should
be nearly equal. An increasing number of people are
becoming lacto-vegetarians, which means that they eat no
meat or fish, but balance their absence by using more
milk, eggs and cheese.</p>

<p>Before starting to prepare a meal the Scout should not
only have her menu in mind, but should have an idea
how long it will take to prepare each dish so that everything
will be ready to serve at the same time with all the
hot dishes very hot and all the cold dishes very cold. If
all the dishes of the meal require about the same length
of time in their preparation the ones should be started
first which can be most easily kept in good condition.</p>

<p>Enjoyment of a meal depends quite as much on neat
and comfortable service as it does upon good food. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
table cloth, napkins, dishes and silver should be clean
and the dishes should be arranged so that there is as
little danger as possible of accident. This is the reason,
for example, for the rule that a spoon should never be
left in a coffee or tea cup. This arrangement is usually
more comfortable if nothing is placed on the table which
is not going to be actually used at the meal, except that
a few flowers or a little dish of ferns in the center of the
table is very much liked by most people, if there is room
for it. It often happens that the family see more of each
other at meal times than at any other time in the day
and everyone should try to make meal time a pleasant,
restful, good-humored time.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Household Weights and Measures</span></div>

<p>The careful housewife soon becomes skilled in weighing
and measuring the various goods she buys and uses.
At the store she is on guard against short measures, and
if she does not market in person, she has machines at
home to test what is delivered. The following table is
given for frequent reference use by the Girl Scout while
earning her badges in Homecraft. She will also find it
useful in learning to judge weights and distances for her
First Class test.</p>

<h3><br />2. THE CHILD NURSE</h3>

<p>There always are and always will be children to be
taken care of. There is no way in which a girl can
help her country better than by fitting herself to undertake
the care of children. A Girl Scout thinks for herself,
and knowing the Health Laws, she knows the important
things to consider in caring for children:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The care necessary for the child's bones.</p>

<p>2. When it should exercise its muscles.</p>

<p>3. Its rest.</p>

<p>4. The air, sun and food and water which it needs.</p>

<p>5. How to keep it clean.</p></div>

<p><i>Bones</i>&mdash;Great care must be taken in handling a baby.
Its bones are soft and easily injured, and for this reason
a baby should not be handled more than necessary. When
very young its entire spine should be supported, and no
undue pressure made upon the chest, as often happens
if the baby is grasped under the arms. In lifting a young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
baby from its bed, the right hand should grasp the
clothing below the feet, and the left hand should be
slipped beneath the infant's body to its head. It is then
raised upon the left arm. An older child should be
lifted by placing the hands under the child's arms, and
never by the wrists. If children are jerked or lifted
by the arms, serious injury may be done to the bones.
The bones, when a child is growing, are partly composed
of soft tissue which is easily destroyed, and further
growth is prevented. Many children are brought to the
hospitals with injuries done to their arms from being
jerked across the street. Do not let a child walk too
soon, especially a heavy child. Bow legs and knock knees
come from standing and walking when the bones are
soft.</p>

<p><i>Exercise</i>&mdash;At least twice a day an infant should be
allowed for fifteen or twenty minutes the free use of
its limbs by permitting it to lie upon a bed in a warm
room, with all clothing except the shirt and diaper removed.
In cold weather leave on the stockings. Later,
when in short clothes, the baby may be put upon a thick
blanket or quilt, laid upon the floor, and be allowed to
tumble at will.</p>

<p><i>Rest</i>&mdash;Healthy children never sleep too much. A new
born baby should sleep nine-tenths of the day. A child
should have a nap during the day until four years old,
and, if possible, until seven or eight years old. It should
go to bed before six. It should have a crib or bed to
itself, placed where it will have fresh air, but protected
from draughts, and its eyes protected from direct rays
of light.</p>

<p><i>Air and Sun</i>&mdash;A little child is in its room so much it
is very important that fresh air and sunlight should be
brought to it there. Rooms may be well aired twice or
three times a day, removing the baby to another room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
while the windows are open. The child may be placed
in its crib or carriage before on open window, dressed
as if for the street. After children are three months
old they may be taken out, but the sunny part of the
day should be chosen, between 10 a. m. and 3 p. m. in
cold weather. At night the windows should be partly
opened, but care should be taken that the infant does not
become chilled. Be careful that sheet and blankets do
not get over a baby's head. The clothes may be pinned
to the side of the bed.</p>

<p><i>Food and Water</i>&mdash;Even little babies should be given
water twice a day. The water should be boiled, cooled
and kept covered. It is hardly possible for children or
older persons to drink too much water. During hot
weather a child needs more water than during cold
weather.</p>

<p>Mother's milk is the only perfect food for an infant
during the first nine or ten months. If it is necessary
to give artificial food from a bottle, the greatest possible
care must be taken. The milk used should be the best
obtainable. To obtain clean milk it is necessary that
everything that touches it be clean, sterilized when possible,
and that the cows, and men who handle the milk
be healthy. In New York City all milk is classified
according to its cleanliness and butter fat content. The
cleanest and richest milk is called "certified milk" and
is sold raw. The other milks are classified according to
cleanliness. Grade A, B and C are all pasteurized. Only
certified and Grade A should be used for infant feeding.
You know that sterile means free from germs or bacteria.
Milk or water may be made comparatively sterile
by boiling. Pasteurized milk is milk which has been
heated to 155&deg; Fahrenheit, kept at that temperature for
thirty minutes and cooled quickly by placing the bottles
in cold running water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Punctual feeding makes good digestion, and even if
the baby takes an extra nap it is better to wake a healthy
baby to give him his meals at regular hours than to let
his digestion get out of order. Between meals a little
water which has been boiled and cooled and kept covered
will wash out its mouth as well as refresh the child.
The average infant is fed every three hours until it is
five months old. After that it is fed every four hours
until it is fifteen or sixteen months old, when it is shifted
to three meals a day with perhaps a cup of milk in long
intervals. Solid food, such as zwieback and milk or
cereal, is begun at seven months, and by thirteen or fourteen
months the child will be eating cereal, bread, broth,
beef juice, potato, rice, vegetables, etc. Candy is harmful
for children, and even older children should eat candy
only after meals. Raw fruit, except orange juice, is apt
to be upsetting in summer.</p>

<p>Keep the baby and everything around him clean. The
baby's food is the most important thing to keep clean.
The cleanliness of the bottle, when it is necessary to feed
the baby from one, is very important. Choose a bottle
of fairly heavy glass with rounded bottom and wide
mouth, so that it may be easily cleaned. Short rubber
nipples which clip over the neck of the bottle and which
can be easily turned inside out, should be selected, and
discarded when they become soft, or when the openings
become large enough for the milk to run in a stream
instead of drop by drop. Remove the bottle from the
baby's mouth as soon as empty, rinse at once in cold
water and then fill with a solution of bicarbonate of
soda (baking soda), about one teaspoonful to a pint
of water. Before rinsing wash in hot soapsuds, using
a bottle brush, rinse well in plain water, and boil for
twenty minutes, placing a clean cloth in the bottom of
the basin to protect the bottle from breaking. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
using new nipples they should be scrubbed inside and
out and boiled for at least five minutes. After using
they should be carefully rinsed in cold water and kept
in a covered glass containing a solution of boric acid
(one teaspoonful dissolved in a pint of boiling water),
and at least once a day be turned inside out and thoroughly
washed with soap and water, then rinsed. Nipples
should be boiled twice a week.</p>

<p><i>Bath</i>&mdash;A baby should have a bath every day, not
sooner than one hour after feeding. The room should
be warm; if possible there should be an open fire in
the room. The temperature of the water for a baby
up to six months old should be 98&deg;. Then it should
gradually decrease, next temperature being 95&deg;, until
at the age of two it should range between 85&deg; to
90&deg;. Before a baby is undressed the person who is
bathing the baby must be sure that everything needed
for the bath and dressing is at hand. The hand basin
or small tub of warm water, a pitcher of hot water
in case it is needed, castile or ivory soap, soft wash
cloths, towels, brush, powder, fresh absorbent cotton,
boric acid solution, and the baby's clothes laid out in
the order in which they will be needed in dressing the
child, the soft flannel bandage, the diapers, the shirt,
flannel petticoat, dress and shawl.</p>

<p>For some people it is easier to handle a baby when
laid on a bed or table than on one's lap, having under
the child a soft bath towel or canton flannel large enough
to be wrapped around it. Its nose may be cleaned with
a bit of absorbent cotton rolled to a point, using a fresh
piece for each nostril. To bathe the eyes use fresh
pieces of absorbent cotton dipped in boric acid solution.
Wash the baby's face carefully so that the water does
not drip into its ears. Dry the face carefully. Wash
the head gently and thoroughly with soap, being careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to rinse completely. Soap the baby's body before putting
it into the bath. As a soapy little baby is difficult to hold,
support him firmly all the time he is kicking and splashing,
by placing the arm or hand at the baby's back between
its shoulders. Wash particularly, under the arms,
the creases in the back of the neck, between the legs,
fingers and toes. The bath should be given quickly
and the baby lifted out in the bath towel or flannel,
covered and dried quickly, using a soft towel. Rub
the baby very slightly. All the folds of the skin should
be dried and well powdered: under the arms, behind
the ears, about the neck, legs, etc. Do not put too much
powder on, as it forms a paste. Dress the infant and
lay it on its crib while putting away all the things used
for its bath. It is perfectly proper for a baby to exercise
its lungs by crying, so do not be alarmed, but be
sure that its clothing is comfortable and that the child
is clean. Garments worn at night should always be
different from those worn during the day. The garments
next to the skin should be of wool or part wool,
except the diaper, which should be soft cotton, and
when new, washed several times before using. Wet
diapers should be rinsed in cold water and dried before
using a second time; about every twenty-four hours
diapers should be washed, scalded, rinsed in cold water
and hung in the air to dry.</p>

</table></div>
<p>A baby needs to be kept quiet. Do not make loud
noises near it. Do not play with infant too much.
Leave it to itself to grow. Keep the baby clean, everything
about it tidy. Do not give a child pointed toys
or playthings small enough to go into the infant's mouth.
Tie toys to the crib or carriage so that they do not fall
on the floor.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Things to Remember</b></div>

<p>Emphasize "tidy as you go," sleep, water, bowel movements,
exercise for older children, especially in cold
weather, nothing in mouth, do not use pacifiers, tying
toys to crib or carriage, a baby over two years of age
should not be fed oftener than every four hours.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Bowel Movements</b></div>

<p>At least once a day.</p>

<p>Should be medium soft, not loose, smooth, and when
on milk diet, light in color.</p>

<p>If child is constipated, give one teaspoonful of milk
of magnesia clear, at night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>See doctor if child is not well.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Feedings</b></div>

<p>Children from birth to five months should be fed every
three hours.</p>

<p>Children over one and a half years old need three
meals a day, dinner in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>Little children need to be kept very quiet. No confusion
or loud noises around them. They will then
grow better and stronger.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Colds</b></div>

<p>Never neglect a cold. Do not "pass it on" to a child
by coughing, sneezing, talking or breathing into its face.
Do not kiss anyone when you have a cold. Never allow
the handkerchief used by a person with a cold to touch
a child. If you must handle a child when you have a
cold, wear a piece of gauze over your mouth and nose,
and be sure to keep your hands clean. Be very careful
with the handkerchiefs used; see that no one touches
or uses them. It is preferable to use gauze or soft
paper for handkerchiefs and burn them. When a child
has a cold put it to bed. Keep quiet as long as there
is any fever. Give a cathartic, such as castor oil, as
soon as cold appears. Reduce the child's diet and give
plenty of drinking water. Consult a doctor. Do not let
the child go out until thoroughly well.</p>


<h3><br />3. THE FIRST AIDE IN ACCIDENTS AND
EMERGENCIES</h3>

<div class='center'><br /><b>General Rules</b></div>

<p>The sorrow and unhappiness of the world is increased
enormously every year by injury and loss from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
accidents, more than half of which might be prevented
if someone had not been careless, or if someone else
had taken a little trouble to correct the results of that
carelessness before they caused an accident.</p>

<p>It therefore becomes the plain duty of Girl Scouts
not only to be careful but to repair, if possible, the
carelessness of others which may result in accident.</p>

<p>Let us review briefly some of the many small things
in our daily lives which cause accidents, and therefore
suffering and loss.</p>

<p>1. <i>Carelessness in the Street.</i> As, for example, taking
chances in getting across in front of a car or automobile;
running from behind a car without looking to
see of some vehicle is coming from another direction;
catching a ride by hanging on to the rear end of cars
or wagons; getting off cars before they stop; getting on
or off cars in the wrong way; being too interested to
watch for open manholes, cellarways, sewers, etc.; reckless
roller skating in the street, throwing things like
banana peels on the street or sidewalk where people
are likely to slip on them; teasing dogs, or trying to
catch strange ones; many dogs resent a stranger petting
them and use their only means of defense&mdash;biting.
Other examples will occur to you of carelessness in the
streets which space does not allow us to mention here.</p>

<p>Wait until the car stops before trying to get off. In
getting off cars you should face in the direction in which
the car is going. A simple rule is to get off by holding
a rod with the left hand and putting the right foot
down first. This brings you facing the front of the
car and prevents your being swept off your feet by
the momentum of the car.</p>

<p>If you see any refuse in the street which is likely
to cause an accident, either remove it yourself or report
it to the proper authorities to have it removed at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Carelessness at Home.</i> As for example, starting the
fire with kerosene; leaving gas jets burning where curtains
of clothing may be blown into the flame; leaving
clothing or paper too near a fire; throwing matches you
thought had been put out into paper or other material
which will catch fire easily; leaving oily or greasy rags
where they will easily overheat or take fire spontaneously;
leaving objects on stairs and in hallways which
will cause others to fall; leaving scalding water where a
child may fall into it or pull it down, spilling the scalding
water over himself; leaving rags or linoleum with upturned
edges for someone to fall over; and innumerable
other careless things which will occur to you.</p>

<p>3. <i>Disobedience</i>, playing with matches; building fires
in improper places; playing with guns; trying the "medicines"
in the closet; throwing stones; playing with the
electric wires or lights; playing around railroad tracks
and bridges: We could multiply the accidents from disobedience
indefinitely. Remember, a caution given you
not to do something means there is danger in doing
it, which may bring much sorrow and suffering to yourself
and others.</p>

<p>It is a very old saying that "An ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure," but it is as true today
as it was hundreds of years ago.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>After the Accident</b></div>

<p>When the time for prevention is past, and the accident
has happened, then you want to know what is
the best thing to do, and how best to do it in order to
give the most help and relief immediately, before expert
help can arrive, and to have the victim in the best
condition possible for the doctor when he comes, in
order that he may not have to undo whatever has been
done before he can begin to give the patient relief from
his suffering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Keep cool. The only way to do this effectually
is to learn beforehand what to do and how to do it.
Then you are not frightened and can do readily and
with coolness whatever is necessary to be done.</p>

<p>2. Send at once for a doctor, if you have a messenger,
in all except the minor accidents. This book will
help you learn to judge of whether a doctor will be
necessary. If in doubt send for a doctor anyway.</p>

<p>3. Prevent panic and keep the crowd, if there is
one, at a distance. The patient needs fresh air to breathe,
and space around him.</p>

<p>4. Loosen the clothing, especially any band around
the neck, tight corsets or anything else that may interfere
with breathing.</p>

<p>5. <i>Keep the patient flat on his back</i> if the accident
is at all serious, with the head slightly down if his face
is pale and he is faint, or slightly raised if his face is
flushed and he is breathing heavily, as though snoring.</p>

<p>6. <i>If there is vomiting</i>, turn the head to one side in
order that the vomited material may easily run out of
the mouth and not be drawn into the windpipe and produce
choking to add to the difficulties already present.</p>

<p>7. <i>Remove clothing</i>, if necessary, gently and in such
manner as to give the patient the least amount of suffering.
Move any injured part as little as possible. At
the same time, as a secondary consideration, injure the
clothing as little as possible. If, as often, it becomes
necessary to cut off the clothing, it may be possible to
rip up a seam quickly instead of cutting the cloth, but
saving the clothing is always secondary to the welfare
of the patient. Little or no consideration should be
shown for clothing where it is necessary to keep the
patient motionless, or where quick action is needed.</p>

<p>8. <i>Transportation.</i> There are three methods for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
emergency transportation of accident victims which can
be used according to the degree of the injury:</p>

<p>(a) <i>Fireman's Lift.</i> If it is necessary for one person
to carry a patient, it is easily possible to lift and
carry quite a weight in the following manner:</p>

<p>First, turn the patient on his face, then step astride
his body, facing toward his head, and, with hands under
his armpits, lift him to his knees, then clasp your
hands over the patient's abdomen and lift him to his
feet; then draw his left arm around your neck and
hold it against the left side of your chest, the patient's
left side resting against your body, and supporting him
with your right arm about the waist. Then drop the
patient's left hand and grasp his right wrist with your
left hand and draw the right arm over your head and
down upon your left chest; then stooping, clasp his
right thigh with your right arm passed between the
legs (or around both legs) and with a quick heave lift
the patient to your shoulders and seize his right wrist
with your right hand, and lastly, grasp the patient's
left hand with your left hand to steady him against your
body. (Work this out with a companion as you read it.)</p>

<p>(b) A seat made of four arms and hands (which
you have no doubt used in your play), may be used for
the lesser injuries. If the patient can, he supports himself
by putting his arms around the necks of his carriers,
each of whom in the meantime grasps one of his own
wrists and one of his partner's. This makes a comfortable
seat for carrying. If the patient needs supporting,
a back may be improvised by each carrier grasping the
other's arm below the shoulder to form the back and their
other hands clasped to form the seat. A better seat may
be made with three hands clasping the wrists, while the
fourth arm is used as a back, by one clasping the other's
arm below the shoulder. This does not provide a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
secure back, however, as it is not easy to hold the arm
against much of a weight from the patient's body.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Improvised Stretcher.</i> When the patient shows
any sign of shock, is unconscious, has a serious fracture
of some bone or bones, has a serious injury to any
part of the body, or is bleeding excessively, he must be
carried lying down. It may be that there will be no
regular stretcher at hand. In that case one must be
improvised. A serviceable one can be made from ordinary
grain or flour bags by cutting the two corners at
the bottom and running two poles inside the mouth of
the bags and through the holes.</p>

<p>A workable stretcher can be made from coats by turning
the sleeves inside out, passing the poles through the
sleeves and buttoning the coat over the poles. This brings
the turned sleeves on the inside. A five-bar gate or a door,
if it can be gotten without delay, also make satisfactory
emergency stretchers.</p>

<p>A stretcher may also be made out of dress skirts,
with or without poles. Put the skirts together, bottoms
slipped past each other, and slip the poles through, as
with the bags. If no poles are available, roll the edges
of the skirts over several times to form a firm edge,
and carry with two or four bearers, as the size and
weight of the patient make necessary.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Minor Injuries and Emergencies</b></div>

<p>Minor injuries may or may not need the aid of a
doctor, and you must learn to use judgment as to the
necessity of sending for one. We will consider these
minor injuries in groups to remember them more easily.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>1.</b> (a) BRUISES; (b) STRAINS; (c) SPRAINS</div>

<p>(a) A <i>Bruise</i> is produced by a blow which does not
break the skin, but does break the delicate walls of the
capillaries and smaller veins, thus permitting the blood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to flow into the surrounding tissues, producing the discoloration
known as "black and blue."</p>

<p>(b) <i>A Strain</i> is produced by the overstretching of
muscles or ligaments, or both, but not tearing them. It
may or may not be accompanied by breaking of capillary
walls with discoloration. Any muscle or ligament may be
strained.</p>

<p>(c) <i>A Sprain</i> is produced by the overstretching of
the muscles or ligaments or both about a <i>joint</i>. There
may also be some tearing of the fibres or tearing loose
from their attachments. This always breaks capillaries
or small veins, making the surface black and blue. This
discoloration usually appears some time after the accident,
because the broken blood vessels are far below
the surface.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;For bruises and strains it is seldom necessary
to call a doctor. Apply cold, either by wringing
cloths out of cold water and applying, or by holding the
injured part under the cold water tap. Do this at
intervals of several hours, until the pain is lessened.
The cold may be alternated with hot water which must,
however, be quite hot, just enough not to burn, as lukewarm
water is almost useless. Some patients will prefer
to use only hot water. The water followed by applications
of tincture of arnica, witch hazel, or alcohol and water,
half and half, and bandaging will be sufficient.</p>

<p>If, however, there has been no black and blue at first,
as in a bruise, but it begins to show later, and the pain
continues severe, and there is a good deal of swelling,
then you should send for a doctor, as more than first
aid is needed.</p>

<p>In case of <i>sprain</i>, send for a doctor, and in the meantime
elevate the joint and apply hot or cold water, or
alternate hot and cold, as patient prefers. This will
give relief by contracting the blood vessels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>2.</b> (a) BURNS; (b) SCALDS; (c) SUNBURN;
(d) FROSTBITE</div>

<p>(a) <i>Burns</i> are produced by dry heat, as a fire, acids,
alkalis, etc., and may be of all degrees, from a superficial
reddening of the skin to a burning of the tissues
to the bone.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Scalds</i> are produced by moist heat, and may be
of the same degrees as those produced by dry heat.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Sunburn</i> is produced by the sun, and is usually
superficial, but may be quite severe.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Frostbite</i> is produced by freezing the tissues and
is usually not dangerous. The more severe types will be
treated later under Freezing.</p>


<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;(a) <i>Burns</i>; (b) <i>Scalds</i></p>

<p>1. Except in the minor burns and scalds, send for
the doctor at once.</p>

<p>2. The first thing to do is allay pain by protecting
the injured part from the air.</p>

<p>3. For a burn produced by fire, cover with a paste
made of baking soda and water, or smear with grease&mdash;as
lard, carron oil (mixture of linseed oil and lime
water&mdash;half and half) or vaseline or calendula cerate.
Cover with a piece of clean cloth or absorbent gauze and
bandage loosely or tie in place. Gauze prepared with
picric acid, if at hand, is a most satisfactory dressing. It
can be purchased and kept on hand for emergencies.</p>

<p>4. In burns from alkalis or acids, wash off as quickly
as possible and neutralize (make inactive the acids with
baking soda, weak ammonia or soapsuds; the alkalis
with vinegar or lemon juice). Afterward treat like other
burns.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Sunburn</i> is an inflammation of the skin produced
by the action of the sun's rays and may be prevented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
by gradually accustoming the skin to exposure to the
sun. It is treated as are other minor burns.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Frostbite</i>&mdash;<i>Prevention</i>&mdash;1. Wear sufficient clothing
in cold weather and keep exposed parts, such as
ears and fingers, covered.</p>

<p>2. Rub vigorously any part that has become cold.
This brings the warm blood to the surface and prevents
chilling.</p>

<p>3. Keep in action when exposed to the cold for any
length of time. The signs of danger are sudden lack
of feeling in an exposed part, and a noticeably white
area. Chilblain is an example of frostbite.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;The circulation of the blood through the
frozen part must be restored gradually. This must be
done by rubbing the part first with cold water, which
will be slightly warmer than the frozen part, and
<i>gradually</i> warming the water until the circulation and
warmth is fully restored. Then treat as a minor burn.
If heat is applied suddenly it causes death of frozen parts.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>3.</b> SPLINTERS, SMALL CUTS, SCRATCHES
AND PIN PRICKS</div>

<p>None of these injuries will usually require a doctor
if properly treated in the beginning. The bleeding from
any of them is not sufficient to be dangerous. But
whenever there is a break in the skin or mucous membrane
there is danger of infection by germs, and this is
what makes the first aid treatment in these cases so
important. A tiny scratch is sometimes converted into
a bad case of blood poisoning by not being properly
treated at first.</p>

<p>Splinters should be removed by using a needle (not
a pin) which has been sterilized by passing it through
a flame (the flame of a match will do if nothing better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is at hand). After the splinter is out, the wound is
treated like a cut or scratch.</p>

<p>The germs which produce poisoning do not float
in the air, but may be conveyed by any thing which is
not sterile, as, for instance, the splinter or the instrument
that did the cutting, scratching or pricking. They
may be carried to the scratch by our hands, by water,
or cloth used for dressings.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Wash your own hands thoroughly with
soap and water, using a nail brush. Clean the injured
part well with disinfectant, as, for instance, alcohol and
water, half and half, or peroxide of hydrogen&mdash;paint
the spot with iodine, and cover with sterile gauze (if
this is not to be had, use a piece of clean cloth that
has been recently ironed), and bandage in place. If
the bleeding is severe, a little pressure with the bandage
over the dressing will stop it. Use the same precautions
if the wound has to be re-dressed.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>4.</b> STINGS AND BITES OF INSECTS</div>

<p>The poison injected by the sting or bite of an insect
is usually acid, and the part should be washed at once
with a solution of ammonia or soda (washing soda) to
neutralize the poison. Then apply a paste of soda bicarbonate
(baking soda) or wet salt and bandage in
place. If the sting is left in the wound it must be pulled
out before beginning treatment.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>5.</b> FOREIGN BODIES IN THE (a) EYE (Cinder)
(b) EAR (Insect), (c) NOSE (Button)</div>

<p>(a) <i>Eye</i>&mdash;If a cinder, eyelash, or any tiny speck gets
into the eye it causes acute pain, and in a few minutes
considerable redness.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Do not rub the eye, as this may press
the object into the tender cornea so that it can be removed
only with difficulty and by a physician. First<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
close the eye gently, pull the eyelid free of the ball,
and the tears may wash out the speck. If this is not
successful, close the eye, hold the lid free, and blow
the nose hard. You may then be able to see the speck
and remove it with a bit of clean cotton or the corner
of a clean handkerchief. If the object is lodged under
the lid, and the foregoing efforts do not dislodge it,
proceed to turn the lid up as follows:</p>

<p>Ask the patient to look at the floor, keeping the
eyeball as stationary as possible. Take a clean wooden
toothpick or slender pencil, wrapped with cotton,
place on the upper lid about one-fourth of an inch
from the edge, grasp the eyelashes with the other hand,
give a slight push downward toward the cheek with the
toothpick, a slight pull upward on the lashes and turn
the lid over the toothpick. Remove the speck and slip
the lid back in position. Wash the eye with boric acid
solution.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to dislodge the body, discontinue
any further efforts, apply a cloth wet in cold boric
acid solution and send for the doctor. Anything done
to the eyes must be done with the greatest gentleness.</p>

<p>If an acid has entered the eye, neutralize it with a
weak solution of soda bicarbonate in water. If an alkali
(lime) is the offending substance, neutralize by a weak
vinegar solution. Follow in each case with a wash of
boric acid solution.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Ear</i> (Insect); (c) <i>Button in Nose</i>&mdash;Foreign
bodies in the ear and nose are not very common.</p>

<p>But sometimes a child slips a button or other small
object into these cavities, or an insect may crawl in.
Drop in a few drops of sweet oil and if the object
comes out easily, well and good. If not, do not keep
on trying to extract it, for fear of greater injury. Send
for the doctor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>6.</b> IVY AND OAK POISONING</div>

<p>There is a poison ivy (or poison oak) which is
very poisonous to some people, and more or less so to
all people. The poison ivy has a leaf similar to the
harmless woodbine, but the leaves are grouped in threes
instead of fives. The poison given off by these plants
produces a severe inflammation of the skin. In the
early stages it may be spread from one part of the body
to another by scratching.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Wash the irritated surface gently with
soap and water, and then apply a paste of soda bicarbonate
or cover quickly with carbolated vaseline. Another
remedy is fluid extract <i>grindelia robusta</i>, one
dram to four ounces of water. Sugar of lead and alcohol
have also been found useful. For severe cases consult
a doctor, especially if the face or neck or hands
are affected.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>7.</b> (a) FAINTING; (b) HEAT EXHAUSTION</div>

<p>(a) <i>Fainting</i> is caused by lack of blood in the brain,
and usually occurs in overheated, crowded places, from
fright or from overfatigue.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms</i>&mdash;1. The patient is very pale and partially
or completely unconscious.</p>

<p>2. The pulse is weak and rapid.</p>

<p>3. The pupils of the eyes are normal.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;1. If possible put the patient flat on his
back, with the head slightly lower than the rest of the
body.</p>

<p>2. If there is not room to do this, bend the patient
over with his head between the knees until sufficient
blood has returned to the brain to restore consciousness.</p>

<p>3. Then get the patient into the fresh air as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>4. Keep the crowd back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Loosen the clothing about the neck.</p>

<p>6. Apply smelling salts to the nose.</p>

<p>7. When the patient has recovered sufficiently to
swallow, give him a glass of cold water, with one-half
teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia if necessary.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Heat Exhaustion</i> is exhaustion or collapse due
to overheating where there is not sufficient evaporation
from the surface of the body to keep the temperature
normal.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms</i>&mdash;1. The patient is usually very weak.</p>

<p>2. The face is pale and covered with a clammy sweat.</p>

<p>3. The pulse is weak and rapid.</p>

<p>4. The patient is usually not unconscious.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;1. Remove the patient to a cool place and
have him lie down.</p>

<p>2. Loosen the clothing.</p>

<p>3. Give him a cold drink to sip.</p>

<p>4. Put cold cloths on his head.</p>

<p>5. Send for the doctor.</p>

<p>6. If necessary, give stimulant as in fainting.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>8.</b> (a) CHOKING: (b) HICCOUGH</div>

<p>(a) <i>Choking</i>&mdash;Choking is produced by something
lodged in the throat, does not require artificial respiration,
but a smart slap on the back to aid in dislodging
whatever is blocking the air passage. It may be necessary
to have the patient upside down, head lower than
feet, to aid in getting out the foreign body. This is a
comparatively simple matter with a child, but is not
so easy with an adult. When the object is not too
far down the throat it may be necessary for someone
to use his fingers to pull out the offending substance to
keep the patient alive until the doctor can arrive. In
this case wedge the teeth apart with something to prevent
biting before trying to grasp the object.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Hiccough</i>&mdash;This is usually due to indigestion or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
overloading of the stomach. Holding the breath for
one-half minute will usually cure it, as it holds quiet
the diaphragm (the large muscular and fibrous partition
between the chest and abdomen), and overcomes
its involuntary contractions which are causing the hiccoughs.
A scare has the same effect sometimes. If
the hiccoughs still continue troublesome after these simple
remedies try to cause vomiting by drinking lukewarm
water, which will get rid of the offending material
causing the hiccough, and relieve the distress.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>9.</b> NOSE BLEED</div>

<p>The ordinary nose bleed will soon stop from the
normal clotting of the blood and does not require treatment.</p>

<p>(a) Keep head elevated, with patient sitting up if
possible. Do not blow the nose, as this will dislodge
any clot which may have formed, and the bleeding will
begin again. Any tight collar around the neck should
be loosened.</p>

<p>(b) If the bleeding seems excessive, apply cloths
wrung out of ice water to the back of the neck and over
the nose.</p>

<p>(<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'e'">c</ins>) If the bleeding still continues and is abundant,
pack the nostril with a cotton or gauze plug. Pack
tightly (with a blunt end of a pencil if nothing else is
at hand) <i>and send for the doctor at once</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Major Injuries and Emergencies</b></div>


<div class='center'><br />1. (a) DISLOCATIONS; (b) FRACTURES</div>

<p>(a) <i>Dislocations</i>&mdash;In a dislocation the head of a bone
is pushed or pulled out of its socket. A person may
be falling and in trying to save himself catch hold of
something in such a way that he feels a sharp, sudden,
severe pain, and may even feel the head of the bone
slip out at the shoulder or elbow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Symptoms</i>&mdash;1. When you looked at the injured part it
does not look like the other side.</p>

<p>2. If you attempt to move it you find it will no longer
move as a joint does, but is stiff.</p>

<p>3. There is great pain and rapid swelling usually.</p>

<p>4. There may or may not be black and blue spots
around the joint.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Send for a doctor at once. While waiting
for the doctor, place the patient in the easiest position
possible, and apply hot or cold cloths, frequently
changed, to the injured part.</p>

<p>In dislocation of the jaw it may be necessary for someone
to try to replace it before the doctor arrives. The
mouth is open and the jaw fixed. The patient may even
tell you he has felt the jaw slip out of its socket. Wrap
your thumbs in cloth to prevent biting when the jaw
snaps back in place. Place the thumbs on the tops of the
lower teeth on each side, with the fingers outside, and
push firmly down until the head of the bone can slip
over the edge of the socket into place. As you feel the
bone slipping into place, slide your thumbs out to the inner
side of the cheek to prevent biting when the jaws snap
together with the reducing of the dislocation.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Fractures</i>&mdash;<i>Broken bones</i>&mdash;There are two classes
of fractures:</p>

<p>1. <i>Simple</i>&mdash;In a simple fracture the bone is broken,
but the skin is not broken; that is, there is no outward
wound.</p>

<p>2. <i>Compound</i>&mdash;In a <i>compound</i> fracture not only is the
bone broken, but the jagged ends pierce through the skin
and form an open wound. This makes it more dangerous
as the possibility of infection by germs at the time
of the accident, or afterward, is added to the difficulty of
the fracture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Symptoms</i>&mdash;As in dislocation, you should be familiar
with the main symptoms of a broken bone.</p>

<p>1. When you look at the injured part it may or may
not look like its mate on the other side. In the more
severe fractures it usually does not.</p>

<p>2. When you try to move it you find more motion
than there should be, if the bone has broken clear through;
that is, there will seem to be a joint where no joint
should be.</p>

<p>3. The least movement causes great pain.</p>

<p>4. The swelling is usually rapid.</p>

<p>5. The discoloration (black and blue) appears later;
not at once, unless there is also a superficial bruise.</p>

<p>6. The patient is unable to move the injured part.</p>

<p>7. You may hear the grate of the ends of the bone
when the part is moved, but you should not move the
injured bone enough to hear this, especially if the limb
is nearly straight; the detection of this sound should
be left for the doctor.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Send for a doctor at once, and if it will
be possible for him to arrive soon, make the patient as
comfortable as possible and wait for him. However,
if it will be some time before the doctor can arrive you
should try to give such aid as will do no harm and will
help the sufferer.</p>

<p>You must handle the part injured and the patient
with the utmost gentleness to avoid making a simple
fracture into a compound one, or doing other injury,
and also to give him as little additional suffering as
possible. You will need to get the clothing off the part
to be sure of what you are doing. Rip the clothing in
a seam if possible when the fracture is in an arm or
leg, but if this cannot be done, you will have to cut the
material. Do not try to move the broken bone trying
to get off a sleeve or other part of the clothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>With the greatest gentleness put the injured part, for
instance, the arm or leg, as nearly as possible in the
same position as the sound part, and hold it in that position
by splints. Do not use force to do this. There is
no great hurry needed to set a broken bone. The important
point is to get it set right, and this may better
be done after complete rest of several days, allowing for
the passing of the inflammation.<br /><br /></p>


<p><i>The Most Important "What Not to Do Points" for
Fractures Are</i>:</p>

<p>1. If there is reason to think a bone <i>may</i> be broken
try in all ways to prevent motion at <i>point</i> of fracture
lest it be made compound.</p>

<p>2. Do not go hunting for symptoms of fracture (such
as the false point of motion or the sound "crepitus")
just to be sure.</p>

<p>3. The best treatment is to try to immobilize the part
till the doctor comes.</p>

<p><i>Splints</i>&mdash;Anything that is stiff and rigid may be used
for splints. Shingles, boards, limbs of trees, umbrellas,
heavy wire netting, etc. Flat splints are best, however.
All splints should be padded, especially where they lie
against a bony prominence, as for instance, the ankle or
elbow joint.</p>

<p>If the patient is wearing heavy winter clothing this may
form sufficient padding. If not, then other cloth, straw
or leaves may be used. Cotton batting makes excellent
padding but if this is not to be had quickly, other
things can be made to do to pad the first rough splints
which are applied until the patient can reach a doctor or
the doctor arrives on the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>In applying splints remember they must extend beyond
the next joint below and the next joint above, otherwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
movement of the joint will cause movement of the
broken part.</p>

<p>The splints are tied firmly in place with handkerchiefs,
strips of cloth, or bandages, tied over splints,
padding and limb. Do not tie tight enough to increase
the pain, but just enough to hold the splints firmly.
Do not tie directly over the break. There must be an
inner and outer splint for both the arms and the legs.</p>


<div class='center'><br />2. (a) SERIOUS WOUNDS; (b) SERIOUS
BLEEDING</div>

<p>Send for the doctor at once, and then stop the bleeding
and keep as clean as possible till he arrives.</p>

<p><i>Dangers</i>&mdash;1. In any wound with a break in the skin,
there is the danger of infection or blood poisoning, as
you have already learned.</p>

<p>2. In serious wounds through the skin, flesh and blood
vessels there is also the danger of severe bleeding, with
the possibility of the patient's bleeding to death.</p>

<p><i>Infection</i>&mdash;You already know how the germs which
can cause the blood poisoning get into the wound.</p>

<p>(a) by the object that makes the wound</p>

<p>(b) from the clothing of the patient through which
the wound is made</p>

<p>(c) from the rescuer's hands</p>

<p>(d) from the water which has not been sterilized used
in washing the wound</p>

<p>(e) from dirty dressings, that is, dirty in the sense
that they have on them germs which can get into
the wound and cause infection or blood poisoning.</p>

<p>The first two of these chances the Girl Scout will
not be able to control. The last three she can to some
extent prevent. <i>Do not wash, touch or put anything into
a serious wound</i> unless a doctor cannot be found. Only
this sort of thing justifies running risk of infection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Otherwise just put on a sterile dressing and bandage.
In reality washing wounds only satisfies the aesthetic
sense of the operator without real benefit to the patient
in many cases. If a wound has to be cleansed before
the doctor comes use boiled water; if this cannot be had
at once, use water and alcohol half and half.</p>

<p>1. Always wash your hands thoroughly with water,
soap and a nail brush, unless there is necessity for
immediate help to stop bleeding which admits of no
time to clean one's hands. Be sure your nails are
clean.</p>

<p>2. Try not to touch the wound with your hands unless
it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>3. Many wounds do not have to be washed, but dressing
may be applied directly.</p>

<p>4. Having cleansed the wound as best you can, or
all that is necessary, apply sterile cloth for dressing.
This may be gotten at a drug store in a sterile package
ready for use immediately, and is very <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'satifactory'">satisfactory</ins>. If,
however, these cannot be had, remember any cloth like
a folded handkerchief that has been recently washed and
<i>ironed</i> is practically sterile, especially if you unfold it
carefully and apply the inside which you have not touched,
to the wound. Bind the dressing on with a bandage to
keep in place until the doctor arrives.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Serious Bleeding</i>:</p>

<p>It is important that you should learn what is serious
bleeding and this will often help you to be cool under
trying circumstances.</p>

<p>As you learned in your work in minor emergencies,
the bleeding from the small veins and capillaries is not
usually sufficient to be dangerous, and the pressure of
the dressing when put on and bandaged in place will
soon stop it. It may sometimes be necessary to put
more dressing outside of that already on (called re-in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>forcing
it) and bandage again snugly. But if you have
made sure first that there is no large vein or artery
cut, you need not be troubled for fear there will be
serious bleeding before the doctor arrives.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/i022.png" width="359" height="450" alt="Tourniquet" title="" />
</div>


<p><i>Bleeding from an Artery</i>: If an artery is cut the blood
spurts out, the size of the stream depending on the size
of the artery cut. This is the most serious bleeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
because the heart is directly behind, pumping the blood
through the artery with all its power. If it is a small
artery the pressure with the finger between the cut and
the heart for a few minutes will give the blood time to clot
behind the finger and form a plug. This will stop the
bleeding aided by pressure of the bandage. If it is a
larger vessel the force in the heart muscle pumping the
blood will force out any plug formed by the finger there,
as the finger tires too easily.</p>

<p><i>Tourniquet</i>: In this case it will be necessary to put
on a tourniquet to take the place of the finger until
a clot can form in the vessel big enough and strong
enough to prevent the force of the blood current from
pushing it out. This of course can be used only on
the legs or arms.</p>

<p>A tourniquet is something put on to make pressure
on a blood vessel to stop serious bleeding. There are
five points to remember about a tourniquet:</p>

<p>1. It must be long enough to tie around the limb&mdash;a
big handkerchief, towel or wide bandage.</p>

<p>2. There must be a pad to make the pressure over
the artery greater than on the rest of the limb&mdash;a smooth
stone, a darning ball, a large cork, cloth folded into a
large pad or a rolled bandage.</p>

<p>3. The pad must be so placed that the artery lies between
pad and the bone on the limb, in order that the
pressure may stop the flow of blood by forcing the walls
of the artery together between the pad and the bone.</p>

<p>4. Unless the tourniquet is put on tight enough, its
application increases bleeding. It is extremely rare to
find a tourniquet put on tight enough. In almost every
such case removing the tourniquet will stop or partly
lessen bleeding. A short stick or handle is needed,
about a foot long, with which to twist the tourniquet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
sufficiently to stop the flow of blood. Usually it cannot
be twisted tightly enough by hand alone. Tie the twisted
part firmly so it will not slip, after it has been made tight
enough to stop bleeding.</p>

<p>5. Remember, a tourniquet stops most of the circulation
below it as well as in the cut artery, and must not
be left in place too long for fear of injury to the rest
of the limb by cutting off the circulation. <i>Usually it
should not be left on for more than an hour.</i></p>

<p><i>Bleeding from Veins</i>&mdash;Bleeding from the veins is not
so dangerous as from an artery. The blood from the
heart has to go through the little capillaries before it
gets into the veins, and therefore the force of the heart
muscle on the blood in the veins is not so great as in the
arteries. The blood does not spurt out, but flows out as
it would from a bottle tipped on its side.</p>

<p>You have already learned what to do to stop the bleeding
from the smaller veins, and that it is not serious.
From the larger veins, however, it can be very serious,
and it may be necessary for you to put on a tourniquet
before the doctor arrives in order to save the patient's
life.</p>

<p>Almost always bleeding from a vein can be controlled
by clean gauze or handkerchief pad and pressure by hand
directly over the bleeding wound. Tourniquets are almost
never needed in bleeding from a vein. If necessary, it
is wisest to apply them in the same way as for arterial
hemorrhage and stop the circulation in the whole limb.</p>

<p>It is important to know in a general way where the
blood vessels are in order to put the pad over them to
stop the bleeding. Roughly speaking, the artery of the
arm runs down about in a line with the inner seam of the
coat. The large vein lies close beside it, carrying the
blood back to the heart. The artery and vein of the leg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
run about in a line with the inside seam of a man's
trousers.</p>

<p><i>Stimulants</i>&mdash;In serious bleeding of any kind do not
give stimulants until the bleeding has been stopped, as
the stimulants increase the force of the heart and so
increase the flow of blood. After the tourniquet is
on and bleeding is stopped, if the patient is very weak,
he may have a teaspoonful of aromatic spirits of ammonia
in half a glass of water.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(a) SHOCKS; (b) APOPLEXY; (c) CONVULSIONS</div>

<p>(a) <i>Shocks</i>&mdash;In any injury, except the slight ones,
the ends of the nerves in the skin are bruised or jarred.
They send this jar along the nerves to the very delicate
brain. The blood is drawn from the brain into the
larger blood vessels, and the result produced is called
shock. If you have jammed your finger in a door sometime,
perhaps you have felt a queer sick feeling and
had to sit down. A cold sweat broke out all over you,
and you were hardly conscious for a moment or two.
This was a mild case of shock. In more severe injuries
a shock to the brain may be very serious.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Shock</i>&mdash;1. The patient may or may not
be unconscious, but he may take no notice of what is
going on around him.</p>

<p>2. The face is pale and clammy.</p>

<p>3. The skin is cold.</p>

<p>4. The pulse is weak.</p>

<p>5. The breathing is shallow.</p>

<p>In any serious injury the shock is liable to be severe
and will need to be treated before the doctor arrives.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Send for the doctor if serious.</p>

<p>1. Lay the patient flat on his back with head low, so
that the heart can more easily pump the blood back into
the brain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Cover warmly; if they can be gotten, put around
him several hot water bottles or bricks, being extremely
careful to have them covered so that they will not burn
him. Persons suffering from shock are more easily
burnt than usual. Do not put anything hot next him
unless it can be held against your own face for a minute
without feeling too hot.</p>

<p>3. Rub the arms and legs, toward the body, but under
the covers.</p>

<p>4. Give stimulants only after the patient has recovered
enough to swallow, and when there is no serious bleeding.</p>

<p><i>Stimulants</i>&mdash;Strong, hot coffee, or a half teaspoonful
of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a half glass of warm
water. The latter may be given if the coffee is not ready.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Apoplexy</i>&mdash;When a person has a "stroke" of
apoplexy send for the doctor at once.</p>

<p>This condition resembles shock only in that the patient
is unconscious. The blow to the delicate brain does not
come from the outside along the nerves, but from the
inside by the breaking of a blood vessel in the brain,
letting the blood out into the brain tissue and forming a
clot inside of the brain, and thus making pressure which
produces the unconsciousness.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Apoplexy</i>&mdash;1. The patient is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unconcious'">unconscious</ins>.</p>

<p>2. The face is usually flushed&mdash;red.</p>

<p>3. The skin is not cold and clammy.</p>

<p>4. The pulse is slow and full.</p>

<p>5. The breathing is snoring instead of shallow.</p>

<p>6. The pupils of the eye are usually unequally dilated.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;1. Lay the patient flat on his back with
head slightly raised.</p>

<p>2. Do not give any stimulants.</p>

<p>3. Wait for the doctor.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Convulsions</i>&mdash;This condition resembles the foregoing
shock and apoplexy in that the patient is unconscious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Convulsions</i>&mdash;1. The patient is unconscious.</p>

<p>2. The face is usually pale at first, but not so white
as in shock, and later is flushed, often even purplish.</p>

<p>3. The skin is not usually cold.</p>

<p>4. The breathing may be shallow or snoring.</p>

<p>5. There are twitchings of the muscles of the face
and body or a twisting motion of the body.</p>

<p>6. The pulse may be rapid, but is usually regular.</p>

<p>7. The mouth may be flecked with foam.</p>

<p>8. The pupils of the eye may be contracted or equally
dilated.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Convulsions come from various causes,
and are always serious, therefore send for the doctor
at once.</p>

<p>1. Put a wedge of some kind between the teeth if
possible, the handle of a spoon protected by a cloth
cover, or a rolled napkin does well. This is to prevent
biting the tongue, which the patient is apt to do in unconsciousness
with convulsive movements.</p>

<p>2. Lay the patient flat on his back, and prevent him
from hurting himself in his twisting, but do not try to
stop convulsive movement. It will do no good.</p>

<p>3. No stimulant is needed.</p>


<div class='center'><br />(a) SUNSTROKE; (b) FREEZING</div>

<p>(a) <i>Sunstroke</i>&mdash;Sunstroke is caused by too long exposure
to excessive heat, or to the direct rays of the
sun, and is much more serious than heat exhaustion,
which you have already studied.</p>

<p><i>Prevention</i>&mdash;Do not stay out in the direct sunlight too
long on a hot summer day. Wear a large hat which
shades the head and face well, if obliged to be in the
hot sun for any length of time. Do not wear too heavy
clothing in the hot weather. Leaves or a wet sponge
in the top of the hat will help to prevent sunstroke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Drink plenty of cool water between meals.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Sunstroke</i>&mdash;1. The patient is unconscious.</p>

<p>2. The face is red.</p>

<p>3. The pupils large.</p>

<p>4. The skin very hot and dry, with <i>no</i> perspiration.</p>

<p>5. The pulse is full and slow.</p>

<p>6. The breathing is sighing.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;1. Get the patient into the shade where
it is as cool as possible.</p>

<p>2. Send for the doctor.</p>

<p>3. Remove the greater part of the clothing.</p>

<p>4. Apply cold water or ice to the head, face, chest
and armpits.</p>

<p>Often the patient recovers consciousness before the
doctor arrives; give cold water to drink; never stimulants.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Freezing</i>&mdash;This is a much more serious condition
than frostbite, which you have studied, but only because
more of the body is frozen and the tissues are frozen
deeper. Much more care must therefore be taken to prevent
bad effects after the thawing-out process.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Freezing</i>&mdash;1. The patient may or may
not be unconscious.</p>

<p>2. The frozen parts are an intense white and are
without any feeling or motion.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;Send for the doctor at once.</p>

<p>1. Take the patient into a cold room.</p>

<p>2. Remove the clothing.</p>

<p>3. Rub the body with rough cloths wet in cold water.</p>

<p>4. Very gradually increase the warmth of the water
used for rubbing.</p>

<p>5. Increase the temperature of the room gradually.</p>

<p>6. When the patient can swallow, give him stimulants.</p>

<p>7. When the skin becomes more normal in color and
the tissues are soft, showing that the blood is once more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
circulating properly through the frozen flesh, cover the
patient warmly with hot bottles or bricks outside of the
bed clothing, or wraps, and give hot drinks. In using
hot water be sure it is not too hot.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Dog Bite<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></b></div>

<p>In the case of the dog bite we have a more or less
extensive break in the skin and sometimes a deep wound in
the flesh, through which the poison of hydrophobia, which
is a living virus or animal poison, may be introduced, to be
taken up slowly by the nerves themselves, reaching the
central nervous system in about forty days. The slowness
and method of this absorption renders the use of a ligature
useless and unsafe. The treatment for dog bite is
therefore as follows:</p>

<p><i>Immediate.</i> Send for a physician, telling him the reason.
While waiting, treat as any similar wound from any
cause. If the skin is not penetrated, but scratched only,
apply iodine and a sterile or wet dressing. If the skin
is penetrated, the treatment should be the same as for a
wound made by a dirty nail: that is, a small stick, such
as a match, whittled to a point, with a little cotton twisted
on the point, should be dipped into tincture of iodine,
and twisted down into the full depth of the wound, and
then done a second time.</p>

<p><i>Subsequent.</i> A physician should be consulted immediately,
and if there is any suspicion of the dog being sick
it should be kept under observation. The body of a dog
that has been killed under suspicion of rabies or hydrophobia,
should be sent as soon as possible to the proper
authorities.</p>

<p>One of the greatest discoveries in medical science is
the Pasteur treatment for the prevention of hydrophobia
after mad dog bite, and fortunately, provision for this
treatment is so widespread that practically every one in
civilized regions needing it, can have it, as is well known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to all physicians. The fact that the period of development
of the disease is so long makes the possibility of prevention
greater.</p>

<p>It is never proper to suck a dog bite, because the merest
scratch or break in the surface, even if too small to notice,
will serve as a portal of entry for the living virus of
rabies.</p>

<p><i>Snake Bite.</i> For treatment of snake bite see <a href="#Page_297">page 297</a>.</p>


<div class='center'><br />WATER ACCIDENTS</div>

<p>When it is possible, Girl Scouts should learn to swim
well. It is fear when suddenly thrown into the water
that causes so many of the deaths by drowning, and learning
to swim well takes away this fear. A Girl Scout
should also learn how to prevent accidents, and how
best to help the victims of accidents in the water.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Prevention</span></div>

<p>Below are five rules for preventing drowning accidents.</p>

<p>1. Do not change seats in a canoe or rowboat.</p>

<p>2. Do not rock the boat.</p>

<p>3. Do not go out alone in a canoe, rowboat or sailboat
unless you are thoroughly competent to manage such a
boat, in a sudden squall or storm.</p>

<p>4. Very cold water exhausts a swimmer much quicker
than warm water, therefore do not take any chances on
a long swim in cold water unless a boat accompanies you
to pick you up in case of necessity.</p>

<p>5. Be careful not to go too far out when there is a
strong undertow; that is, a strong current below the
surface of the water flowing relentlessly out to sea.</p>

<p>6. Always wade upstream.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Rescue</span></div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i023.png" width="425" height="593" alt="Water rescue" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>When a person gives up the struggle in the water, the
body goes down, and then because of its <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bouyancy'">buoyancy</ins> it
comes to the surface and some air is expelled from the
lungs, making the body less <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bouyant'">buoyant</ins>. It immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sinks again, this time a little lower, and again comes
to the surface, and more air is expelled. This process
may be repeated several times, until sufficient water is
taken into the stomach and lungs to overcome the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bouyancy'">buoyancy</ins>
of the body and it no longer appears at the surface;
but the buoyancy is barely overcome, and therefore the
body will float easily. This can easily be utilized in
saving the drowning person by making the water carry
most of the weight of the body.</p>

<p>To do this, place the hands on either side of the drowning
person's head, and tow him floating on his back
with the face above the surface of the water, while you
swim on your back and keep the body away from you.
Remember, if possible, to go with the current and thus
save necessary strength. In some cases it may be easier
and safer to grasp the drowning person by the hair
instead of trying to clasp the head.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Emergencies</span></div>

<p><i>Grips</i>&mdash;A drowning person is always a frightened person,
and is governed by a mad instinct to grab anything
which subconsciously he thinks may save his life. Usually
he is past any reasoning. He grabs his would-be
rescuer with a death grip that is hard to break, but remember
he instinctively grabs what is above the surface
and will not try to grab below the shoulders.</p>

<p><i>Wrist Grip</i>&mdash;If the drowning person grasps the rescuer's
wrists, the rescuer throws both hands above his
head, which forces both low in the water, and then turns
the leverage of his arms against the other's thumbs and
breaks the grip.</p>

<p><i>Neck Grip</i>&mdash;To release a grip around the neck and
shoulders from the front, immediately cover the mouth
of the other with the palm of the hand, holding the nose
between the first two fingers, and at the same time pull
the other body toward you with the other hand, mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>while
treading water. Then take a full breath and apply
your knee to the other's stomach quickly, thus forcing
him to expel any air in his lungs and preventing him
from getting more air by the hand on mouth and nostrils.</p>

<p>If the grip of the drowning person does not allow
use of the arms, then try to raise your arms to the
level of the shoulder, thus slipping his arms to the neck
and leaving your own arms free to use, as described.</p>

<p><i>Back Grip</i>&mdash;This strangle hold is perhaps the most
difficult to break, and it is necessary to break it instantly
if the rescuer is not also to be in the rescued class.</p>

<p>Grasp the wrists of the other and push sharply back with
the buttocks against the abdomen of the other, and thus
make room to slip suddenly out of the encircling arms.</p>

<p>If this is not successful, do not despair, but throw
the head suddenly against the nose of the drowning
person and then slip out of the grip before he recovers
from his daze.</p>

<p>It is often necessary to dive from the surface in rescuing
a drowning person, and this requires practice, and
should be learned thoroughly before the necessity for
saving a life is presented. Remember that to dive from
the surface to a depth of more than ten feet will usually
require a weight in addition to the weight of the body.
Carry a stone or other heavy object in diving. Then
when wishing to rise to the surface, drop it and push
against the bottom with the feet. This will send the
swimmer to the surface in short order.</p>

<p>In carrying a weight in the water, carry it low on the
body, close to the waist line, leaving one hand and both
feet free for swimming. Or if for any reason it is necessary
to swim on the back, it leaves both feet free to use as
propellers.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Artificial Respiration</span></div>

<p>If the apparently drowned person is to be saved, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
time must be lost in the rescue from the water or in
getting the water out of him, and breathing re-established
after he is brought to land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i024.png" width="425" height="291" alt="Getting the water out" title="" />
</div>

<p>If there is a messenger handy send for a doctor at
once, but in the meantime lose no time in attempting
restoration.</p>

<p>The best method for getting the water out of the lungs
and breathing re-established is the <i>Schaefer Method</i>, because
it is the simplest, requiring only one operator and
no equipment. It can be kept up alone for a long time.</p>

<p>1. Every moment is precious. Immediately lay the
patient face downwards, with the arms extended above
the head and the face to one side. In this position the
water will run out and the tongue will fall forward by
its own weight, and not give trouble by falling back and
closing the entrance to the windpipe. Be sure there is
nothing in the mouth, such as false teeth, gum, tobacco,
etc. Do not put anything under the chest. Be sure there
is no tight collar around the neck.</p>

<p>2. Kneel astride of the patient facing toward his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Place your hands on the small of the patient's back,
with thumbs nearly touching and the hands on the spaces
between the short ribs.</p>

<p>4. Bend slightly forward with arms rigid so that the
weight of your body falls on the wrists, and makes a firm
steady pressure downward on the patient while you count
one, two, three, thus forcing any water and air out of
the lungs.</p>

<p>5. Then relax the pressure very quickly, snatching
the hand away, and counting one-two&mdash;the chest cavity
enlarges and fresh air is drawn into the lungs.</p>

<p>6. Continue the alternate pressing and relaxing about
twelve to fifteen times a minute, which empties and fills
the lungs with fresh air approximately as often as he
would do it naturally.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to work for an hour <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'of'">or</ins> two before
a gasp shows the return of natural breathing. Even then
the rescuer's work is not over, as it will be necessary
to fill in any gaps with artificial breathing. When natural
breathing is established, aid circulation by rubbing and
by wrapping him in hot blankets and putting hot bottles
around him, being careful that they are protected to prevent
burning the patient.</p>

<p>If at any time it is necessary to pull the tongue forward
and to hold it to prevent choking, remember to put
a wedge between the teeth to prevent biting. Do not
give anything liquid by mouth until the patient is conscious
and can swallow readily. Aromatic Spirits of
Ammonia or Spirits of Camphor may be used on a handkerchief
for the patient to smell. The patient should be
watched carefully for an hour or two even after he is
considered out of danger.</p>


<div class='center'>ICE RESCUE</div>

<p>Prevention: Below are two rules for preventing ice
accidents:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Do not skate or walk on thin ice.</p>

<p>2. Watch for air holes.</p>

<p>Rescue: In trying to rescue a person who has broken
through the ice, always tie a rope around your own body
and have this tied to some firm object on shore. Do
not try to walk out to the rescue as the ice will probably
break again under the weight of your body on so small
an area as the size of your feet. Always get a long
board, ladder, rail or limb of a tree, and either crawl
out on this, which will distribute the weight of your
body over a larger surface of ice, or lie flat on your
stomach and crawl out, pushing the board ahead of you
so that the person in the water may reach it. If you
yourself break through the ice in attempting a rescue,
remember that trying to pull yourself up over the edge
of the ice only breaks it more. If rescuers are near it is
much wiser to support yourself on the edge of the ice
and wait for rescue.</p>

<p>After getting the person out of the water use artificial
respiration if necessary and bend every effort to get the
patient warm and breathing properly.</p>


<div class='center'>ASPHYXIATION</div>

<p>Prevention: Below are seven rules for preventing
asphyxiation:</p>

<p>1. When coal stoves and furnaces are freshly filled
with coal, coal gas may escape if the dampers are not
properly regulated. See that all dampers in coal stoves
and furnaces are correctly arranged before leaving them
for any long time, as for the night.</p>

<p>2. Do not go to sleep in a house or room with a gas
jet or gas stove turned low. The pressure in the pipes
may change and the flame go out, or a breeze may blow
out the flame leaving the gas leaking into the room.</p>

<p>3. Do not blow out a gas jet.</p>

<p>4. Be careful to turn off gas jet completely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i025.png" width="425" height="195" alt="Moving someone" title="" />
</div>

<p>5. Report gas leaks promptly.</p>

<p>6. Charcoal stoves and braziers are especially dangerous
from escaping gas and should not be used in sleeping rooms.</p>

<p>7. Do not go into unused wells or underground sewers
without first lowering a lighted candle which will go
out at once if the air is very impure, because of lack of
oxygen to keep it burning.</p>

<p>Rescue: 1. Remove the patient <i>at once</i> to the fresh
air. Gas is lighter than air, and therefore will not be
found close to the floor and it will often be possible to
crawl out when one would be overcome by the gas if he
tried to walk out. For this reason it is sometimes best
in trying to rescue anyone already unconscious from gas
to tie the wrists together with a handkerchief, put his
arms around your neck, and crawl out on all fours, dragging
the insensible body with you, under your own body.
If you attempt to walk out and carry the patient, cover
your mouth and nose with a wet handkerchief, go very
quickly, do not <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'breath'">breathe</ins> until you reach the fresh air.</p>

<p>2. If there is a messenger handy, send for the doctor
at once, but in the meantime if necessary, perform artificial
respiration as outlined under the Schaefer System
in the preceding paragraphs, until the patient is restored
to normal breathing.</p>


<div class='center'>ELECTRIC SHOCK</div>

<p>This is caused by some part of the body coming in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
contact with a live electric wire. The seriousness of the
shock depends on how heavy a charge of electricity the
wire is carrying at the time.</p>

<p>The patient is usually unable to release himself from
the wire. The first thing to be done, if possible, is to
turn off the current by means of the switch, but if this
cannot be done <i>at once</i>, the patient must be rescued by
pulling him away from the wire.</p>

<p>Remember his body will easily carry the charge to
yours while he is against the wire. Therefore you must
"insulate" yourself&mdash;that is, put on your hands something
that will not let the electricity into your body&mdash;or
stand on something that will "insulate" you; for instance,
rubber gloves or rubber tobacco pouches, dry silk handkerchiefs,
other silk garments or newspapers used in
place of gloves if necessary. Stand on a rubber mat or
on <i>dry boards</i>, or glass, or in dire necessity <i>dry</i> clothes
can be used to stand on. They must not be wet as then
they will carry the electric current through your body
and you must also be rescued instead of rescuing.</p>

<p>Prevention: 1. Do not touch the "third rail" of electric
railways.</p>

<p>2. Do not catch hold of swinging wires, they may be
"live wires."</p>

<p>3. Report broken wires to the right authorities.</p>

<p>Treatment:</p>

<p>1. Get patient loose from the current.</p>

<p>2. Send for the doctor.</p>

<p>3. Lay the patient flat on his back.</p>

<p>4. Loosen the clothing, and perform artificial respiration
according to the Schaefer method if necessary.</p>

<p>5. Give first aid treatment to the burns.</p>


<div class='center'><br />FIRE ACCIDENTS</div>

<p>The first thought about a fire is to get it put out before
it spreads any further. There are methods which will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
do this work effectually and Girl Scouts should learn
these methods beforehand thoroughly, in order that when
the emergency arises they may act quickly, coolly and
effectively.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Fire in Clothing</span></div>

<p>If this happens in your own clothing, do not run for
help, as the draft made by the motion of your body will
only fan the flames to burn fiercely.</p>

<p>Grab the nearest thing that will cover you; overcoat,
blanket, rug, wrap it tightly around you at the neck first
to prevent flames from burning the face and lie down
and roll over and over. This will smother the flames
quickly. If you can get nothing to wrap around you, lie
down and roll slowly over and beat the fire with your
hands covered by some part of your clothing not on fire.</p>

<p>If the fire is in the clothing of another, wrap him in
the nearest thing available, lay him on the floor and roll
him over, smothering the flames as described before.</p>

<p>Woolen material will not catch fire as easily as cotton,
therefore, if you have a chance to choose, take woolen
material for smothering the flames.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Results</span></div>

<p>Results of fire in the clothing are sure to be more or
less serious burns.</p>

<p>When you have discovered the extent of the burn, if
it is at all serious, send for the doctor at once, and in the
meantime treat the burn as you have already learned to
do in minor burns.</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Fire in Buildings</span></div>

<p>Keep cool, in order to remember what to do, and do
it quickly.</p>

<p>Turn in a fire alarm at once. Send some one else if
possible who may not know what to do to the fire. The
quickest way is by telephone call, "Fire Department,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and tell them the exact address of the building where
the fire is. Or you may go to the nearest alarm box,
smash the glass, open the door, and pull down the hook
that sounds the alarm. (Generally the directions are
printed on the box.) If you cannot sound the alarm
alone, call upon the nearest person to help you. <i>Wait
there until the firemen arrive and direct them to the fire.</i>
When the firemen come do just as they tell you, for they
know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>People trying to escape from a burning building often
get frightened and then there is a panic. Panic kills more
people than fire. Keep cool, and others will follow your
example.</p>

<p>Never jump from a window unless the flames are so
close that it is your only means of escape. If outside a
burning building put mattresses and bedding piled high
to break the jumper's fall and get a strong hold on a rug
to catch the jumper, and let many people hold the rug.</p>

<p>If the fire is just beginning, it can easily be put out
by smothering it with a rug or blanket; sand, ashes, salt,
or a few pails of water will answer the same purpose.</p>

<p>Keep the doors and windows closed if possible to prevent
draughts from fanning the flames to fiercer effort.</p>

<p>Remember this point when you go into a burning
building, and leave some responsible person guarding the
door, in order that it may not be left open by some one
in excitement and the flames fanned beyond control.</p>

<p>If you need fresh air in your search for people in a
burning building, open a window, put out your head and
draw your lungs full of fresh air and then close the window
again. In any case it is best to tie a wet handkerchief
or towel over the nose and mouth while in a burning
building, as this will prevent you from breathing a
good deal of smoke.</p>

<p>In searching for persons remember always to begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
at the top of the building if possible, and search every
room. When on stairs keep to wall side, where air is
relatively free from flames and smoke. If a room is
locked, try to rouse the people by pounding and calling
and then break in the door if unsuccessful in rousing
them, and you suspect there is some one there.</p>

<p>Remember, the air within six inches from the floor is
usually free from smoke, and if the smoke makes breathing
too difficult, you can still accomplish your end by
crawling along the floor and dragging the rescued one
with you as you learned to do in gas rescue.</p>

<p>Form a bucket brigade from the fire to the nearest
water supply; passing the filled pails from one to another
rapidly, the last throwing the water on the fire and passing
the empty pails back along <i>another</i> line to be filled
again and passed on as before.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Fires from Kerosene, Gasoline, Benzine</span></div>

<p><i>Prevention.</i>&mdash;1. Do not light a fire with kerosene.</p>

<p>2. Do not clean gloves or clothing with gasoline or
benzine in a room with a lamp or gas jet lighted.</p>

<p>3. Do not try to dry clothing that has been cleaned
with gasoline or benzine near a hot stove or lighted gas
jet.</p>

<p><i>Extinction.</i>&mdash;Do not use water to put out a fire of kerosene,
benzine, or gasoline, as that only scatters the flames.
Smother with blankets, rugs, sand, ashes, salt, or anything
which is at hand and can be used; remember that
woolen will not catch fire as easily as cotton.</p>


<div class='center'><br />COMMON POISON AND ANTIDOTES</div>

<p><i>Poisoning</i>&mdash;Cases of poisoning happen most often because
people do not examine the bottles before taking
medicines from them.</p>

<p><i>Prevention</i>&mdash;Disinfectants, liniments and medicines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in bottles and boxes should be correctly and plainly
labelled.</p>

<p>Bottles containing a poisonous substance should be
rough outside, or with notched corks or marked with
something beside the label stating that their contents are
poison.</p>

<p><i>Treatment</i>&mdash;1. <i>Send for the doctor at once</i>, telling
him what kind of poison you think the patient has taken
in order that he may bring the right antidote and the
right implements to give the quickest and most effective
relief.</p>

<p>2. Give demulcent or mucilaginous drinks, as for
example, milk, raw egg, one or two tablespoonfuls of
salad oil, sweet oil, or barley water&mdash;which can be
obtained most readily.</p>

<p>3. Give something to produce vomiting, provided the
lips are not burned or stained as they are with an acid
or alkali. A simple but effectual emetic can be made by
mixing two teaspoonfuls of salt or a tablespoon of mustard
in a glass of lukewarm water. This may be repeated
if necessary.</p>

<p>4. If the patient seems drowsy, suspect opium and
keep patient awake at all costs till the doctor arrives.</p>

<p>5. If delirium threatens, dash cold water on the
patient's head and face to try to prevent the fit from
coming on.</p>

<p>6. When the poison taken has been acid, the antidote
should be an alkali, but different poisons require
different antidotes, and it would be unwise to trust to
one's memory as to the proper one to take in each case.
It would be well to have a list of the more common
poisons and their antidotes attached to the First Aid Kit,
but do not trust to the memory. If a Girl Scout does
not know, and if the patient's lips are <i>not</i> stained or
burned, give an emetic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Bandages</b></div>

<p>Bandages form the most convenient way of keeping
dressings on wounds and for making pressure when
necessary. They are also used to correct some deformities,
but you will not need to concern yourselves
with the latter, as this is in the province of doctors.</p>

<p>There are three varieties of bandages which you will
need to use and with which you should be familiar: the
roller, triangular and four-tailed. The materials used
for bandages are absorbent gauze, muslins or flannels.
The kind you will use most will be gauze and muslin.
The gauze is best to use in dressing wounds because
it is pliable and absorbent, and muslin, if you may
choose, in applying pressure, because it is firm. In an
emergency there will usually be little chance to choose.
Anything at hand, as underclothing, sheets, blankets,
etc., may be torn into strips or triangles and used. Have
the material which is used clean if possible.</p>

<p>The width of the roller bandage depends on the part
of the body to be bandaged, from one inch for the little
finger to four inches for the body. They can be rolled
very well by hand with a little practice, and every Girl
Scout should learn to do this or to improvise a bandage
roller by running a very stiff wire through a small
wooden box and then bending one end on the outside
of the box like a handle.</p>

<p>A bandage must be rolled sufficiently tight so that
the center will not fall out. By folding one end back
and forth a few times to make a core, and then laying
the bandaging over one's knees lengthwise of the thigh
with the core uppermost, it can be rolled quite tightly
and answer every purpose for emergencies.</p>

<p>Learn to put on all bandages smoothly and securely,
but not too tightly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Triangular Bandages</i>&mdash;These bandages have advantages
for first aid work. They can be quickly made,
easily applied and are not apt to be put on too tightly
even by a beginner.</p>

<p>The size of the piece of cloth varies with the part
to be bandaged. Take a square piece of cloth (it should
not be less than 34 to 38 inches), fold it diagonally
from corner to corner and cut across the fold, making
two bandages.</p>

<p>The bandage may be applied unfolded or folded into
a narrow strip, called cravat bandage.</p>

<p>To fold the cravat bandage, the point of the triangle
is brought to the middle of the diagonal side and the
bandage folded lengthwise to the desired width.</p>

<p>The cravat bandage is convenient to use in bandaging
the hand, foot, head, eyes, throat and jaw; for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'trying'">tying</ins> on
splints; for tying around the limb in case of snake bite,
and in making a tourniquet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i026.png" width="450" height="283" alt="Bandages" title="" />
</div>

<p>Always tie the bandage with a square knot to prevent
slipping. Care must be used in applying the triangular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
bandage to have it smooth and firm, folding the loose
ends into pleats evenly.</p>

<p><i>Bandage for Hand</i>&mdash;For wound of the palm, lay
cravat in straight line, place palm across it at the middle.
Fold ends over the back of hand, carry around
wrist and tie. Reverse the order for injury to the
back of the hand.</p>

<p>To cover entire hand, unfold cravat, lay flat with
point of triangle beyond the fingers. Fold the point
of the bandage over the fingers, cross the ends, and
pass around wrist and tie at the back.</p>

<p><i>Bandage for Foot</i>&mdash;Place foot on the smooth triangle
with the point extending beyond the toes several inches.
Fold the point back over the instep, cross the ends,
carry around the ankle and tie.</p>

<p><i>Bandage for the Head</i>&mdash;The bandage may be used
flat or as a cravat, according to the nature of the injury
and the part to be bandaged.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i027.png" width="450" height="278" alt="Bandage for the head" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>For a cap bandage</i>, fold over the edge of the diagonal
edge, place on the head with the folded edge just above
the eyes; pleat the edges hanging down over the ears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
into small folds so that the bandage lies smoothly;
carry the ends around the head; cross at the back, and
tie in a square knot in front. The cravat bandage may
be used to hold on small dressings where the whole
head does not need to be covered.</p>

<p><i>For the eyes, jaw and throat</i> the triangular bandage
is used by folding smoothly into a cravat and tying
securely over the part to be covered.</p>

<p><i>Arm Sling.</i>&mdash;The triangular bandage makes the best
arm sling to support the forearm or for supporting
injuries to the elbow or shoulder.</p>

<p>An arm sling is firmer and more satisfactory if the
triangle is double; that is, simply fold over the square
diagonally, but do not cut it along the fold. An arm
sling will need to be about a yard square before folding.</p>

<p>To adjust the arm sling, put one end over the shoulder
on the uninjured side; slip the point of the triangle
under the injured arm, so that it will extend beyond
the elbow a few inches; then take the end of the bandage
over the arm, carry around the back of the neck
on the injured side, meeting the other end; and tie
securely. To prevent slipping, pin the point of the
bandage around the arm just above the elbow.</p>

<p>A temporary sling can be made by pinning the sleeve
of the injured arm to the dress or coat in such a way
as to support the arm.</p>

<p><i>The Four-tailed Bandage</i>&mdash;This bandage is useful for
bandaging the head, and especially in fracture of the
jaw. Use a piece of cloth about six or eight inches
wide and a yard long. Cut each end into two equal
parts, leaving about three or four inches in the middle
uncut.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 198px;">
<img src="images/i028.png" width="198" height="400" alt="Arm in a splint" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>When the bandage is applied, the split ends are
crossed so that they may be tied over different parts
of the head and thus hold the bandage more securely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
in place. For instance, in the jaw bandage the uncut
middle part is placed over and under the chin, the ends
crossed, and two ends tied at the back of the neck and
two over the top of the head.</p>

<p><i>Roller Bandages</i>&mdash;Roller bandages are a little more
difficult to put on so that they will stay on, and at the
same time be smooth and have a uniform pressure on
the part of the body bandaged. This last point is most
important.</p>

<p>Rules for applying roller bandages:</p>

<p>1. Lay external surface of bandage against the part
to be bandaged, holding the roll in the right hand,
unless you are left-handed, unrolling it as a roll of
carpet unrolls to show you a pattern in the shops.</p>

<p>2. Hold the loose end with the left hand and catch
it with two or three turns of the bandage before beginning
to put on the bandage. Never have more than
four or five inches of the bandage unrolled at once.</p>

<p>3. Be careful to have the same pressure from every
turn of the bandage. This is most important if the
bandage is to stay on and be comfortable and not interfere
with the circulation of the blood. Judgment of
the pressure is only acquired by practice, and therefore
you should practice enough to acquire this before
the real emergency happens.</p>

<p>4. Do not bandage too tightly. Blueness of the skin
above or below the bandage always means the bandage
must be loosened. Remember in applying a bandage
immediately after an injury that considerable swelling
may occur later, and apply your bandage more loosely
than if bandaging after the swelling has gone down.
Always loosen a bandage that is tight enough to cause
pain or blueness.</p>

<p>5. Bandage from below upward. That is, from the
tip of a finger or toe toward the hand or foot. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the hand or foot toward the shoulder or groin. This
is in the general direction of the return of the circulation.</p>

<p>6. Bandage over a splint and not under it.</p>

<p>7. Bandage arms, legs, fingers, etc., in the position
the patient is to keep the part in when the bandaging
is completed. For instance, bend the elbow to a right
angle before putting on the arm bandage. This will
be more comfortable for the patient, allowing him to
carry the arm easily in a sling and also permit him to
use the hand to some extent if the nature of the injury
will permit. In bandaging a leg both above and below
the knee, the bandage must be put on with a view to
the necessary bending of the knee in walking and sitting,
if the patient is expected to use the leg.</p>

<p>8. Never apply a wet bandage, as you cannot judge
of just how much pressure will be exerted when the
bandage dries, because of the shrinkage of cloth with
drying; much greater in some cloth than in others.</p>

<p>Kinds of roller bandages:</p>

<p>1. Circular for parts uniform in size, as the body.</p>

<p>2. Spiral for conical surfaces, as fingers or toes.</p>

<p>3. Reverse for more conical surfaces, as arms and
legs.</p>

<p><i>Circular Bandages</i>&mdash;Any part of the body which is
of uniform size may be covered with a circular bandage.
Each turn covers about two-thirds of the previous turn.
This holds each turn firmly and prevents slipping and
exposing the dressing or wound underneath. Bandage
in general direction of the return of the blood to the
heart. Fasten the bandage with a strip of adhesive
plaster or safety pin. If there is possibility of restlessness
or much activity on the part of the patient, it is
best to run several narrow strips of adhesive plaster
along the whole width of the bandage when finished to
prevent possible slipping of the turns of the bandage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
when the muscles move under it with the activity of
the patient. This is especially true of a body bandage.</p>

<p><i>Spiral Bandage</i>&mdash;A conical part, if not too conical,
may be covered with a spiral bandage. Each turn
ascends at a slight angle, with one edge of the bandage
a little tighter than the other. In putting on this kind
of bandage it is necessary to learn to have the tight
edges all of a uniform pressure and each turn overlap
the turn below in such a way that these tight edges
make the uniform pressure without regard to the upper
edge underneath, which is covered in each turn by the
tighter edge of the turn above it.</p>

<p><i>Reverse Bandages</i>&mdash;The reverse bandage is a modification
of the spiral one, in order to cover the gapping
between spirals which occurs when the surface is very
conical, as, for instance, on the leg.</p>

<p>In putting on this bandage the loose end is caught
by two or three turns first as in other bandages. Then
start to make a spiral turn, but at the mid point of the
front of the part being bandaged place the thumb of
the left hand, and fold the bandage down so that it
lies smoothly and continue the turn around to that same
point. Repeat the process with each turn. (See illustration.)
Each turn covers two-thirds of the one below
in order to hold firmly. The pressure must be uniform
when the bandage is finished. Fasten the ends as described
under circular bandages, or divide the end of
the bandage into two parts for several inches&mdash;long
enough to wind around the part bandaged. Tie a single
knot at the base to prevent further dividing, and wrap
the ends around the part in different directions; tie in a
hard knot to hold firmly.</p>

<p><i>Bandaging Fingers and Toes</i>&mdash;In bandaging fingers
and toes it is usually best to bandage the whole of the
injured member. Cover the end of the finger, for in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>stance,
by passing the end of the half inch or one inch
bandage several times the whole length of the finger,
over the end and to the base of the other side. Hold
this in place with one hand, start the spiral at the end
of the finger, and bandage smoothly toward the hand.
The spiral or the reverse spiral may be used.</p>

<p><i>Bandaging Two or More Fingers or Toes</i>&mdash;It is sometimes
necessary to bandage two or more fingers, for
instance, at once, as in case of a burn, where it is necessary
always to have the burned fingers separated while
healing to prevent the raw places from growing together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i029.png" width="400" height="296" alt="Triangular bandage on hand" title="" />
</div>

<p>Pass a finger bandage twice around the wrist and
pass obliquely to the base of the thumb. Carry to the
end of the thumb and bandage as described above.
When the thumb is bandaged, carry the bandage back
to the wrist; pass around the wrist in one or two circular
turns, and carry the bandage to the first finger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and bandage as before. Repeat this until all the fingers
are bandaged. Carry the bandage back to the wrist,
after the last finger you wish to bandage is done; make
one or two turns around the wrist and fasten.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i030.png" width="400" height="419" alt="Wrapping an ankle with tape" title="" />
</div>

<p>In bandaging the foot, carry the bandage to the ankle
to make secure and hold in place.</p>

<p><i>Bandaging Arms and Legs</i>&mdash;The reverse spiral is
usually best for bandaging these, because of the conical
shape. Practice alone can teach you to put this on
smoothly, firmly, not too tightly, and at the same time
quickly. A reverse bandage will not stay in place on
the leg of the person walking around unless pinned in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
many places or stuck by sizing in the cloth (which has
been wet), plaster, etc. Only a figure eight caught
over the top of the calf, in each alternate loop, will do so.</p>

<p><i>The Figure Eight Bandage</i>&mdash;The figure eight is a
modification of the spiral used in bandaging over joints
in such a way as to permit some motion and at the
same time keep the bandage firm and in place.</p>

<p>The bandage is carried first below and then above
the joint; then below and then above, the turns overlapping
the usual two-thirds of the width of the bandage,
leaving the joint free until the last. Then it may be
covered with two or three circular turns of the bandage.
This admits of considerable motion without disturbing
the bandage to any extent.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The National Red Cross and Girl Scout Instruction
in First Aid</b></div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/i031.png" width="121" height="250" alt="Carrying a child" title="" />
</div>

<p>By special arrangement with the National Red Cross,
it is possible for a Girl Scout completing satisfactorily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the requirements for the First Aid Proficiency Badge
to secure with slight additional work the Red Cross certificate
in First Aid. Or the course may be taken entirely
under Red Cross auspices, though arranged by
Scout officials, in which case the Scout may receive both
the Proficiency Badge and the Red Cross certificate. The
conditions of this co-operation between the Girl Scouts
and the National Red Cross are as follows:</p>

<p>Classes are to be organized with not less than four or
more than twenty-five in a class. The best size is ten to
fifteen. <i>Scouts must be at least sixteen years of age to
be admitted to these classes.</i></p>

<p>The instructor must be a physician appointed by the
Chairman of the First Aid Committee of the local
Chapter of the Red Cross. He or she may be supplied
upon request by the Chapter, or chosen by the class and
the name submitted to the Chapter for appointment.</p>

<p>The Red Cross class roll must be sent in to the local
Chapter early in the course.</p>

<p>A Secretary to handle the records should be chosen,
and where the class is made up of Scouts, the officials
should be preferably a Scout Captain or Scout Official.</p>

<p>The examiner must be a physician appointed by the
local Red Cross Chapter and is preferably some one other
than the instructor, but this is not necessary. Like the
instructor, the examiner may be supplied by the Chapter
or chosen by the class.</p>

<p>The Red Cross examination roll, which may be obtained
from the Chapter, should be used in giving examinations
and then returned to the Chapter, who will issue
the certificates. Follow the directions on the roll carefully.</p>

<p>If a Scout holds a First Aid Proficiency Badge she
may complete the course in seven and one-half hours.
If she does not hold a Proficiency Badge in First Aid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
then fifteen hours will be required. A Girl Scout holding
a Proficiency Badge in First Aid and taking a school
course held under Red Cross auspices which she passes
with a mark of at least seventy-five per cent, can, when
the school principal certifies to this, get the Red Cross
certificate without further examination by applying to
the local Red Cross Chapter.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Advanced Courses</i></div>

<p>Advanced courses are open to those who have the
Red Cross certificate. There must be an interval of at
least six months after the elementary course before an
advanced course can be taken, and the same interval between
repetitions of it. The course of instruction is
seven and one-half hours, mainly practical demonstrations.
A Red Cross medal is given on completion of
this course. Each time it is repeated, up to three times,
a bar (engraved with year) is given to be added to the
medal.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><i>Fees</i></div>

<p>A fee of fifty cents is required for the elementary
course. The local Red Cross Chapter has the right to
reduce this fee.</p>

<p>The fee for the advanced course is one dollar, which
covers the cost of certificate, examination and medal.
The fee for bar and engraving is fifty cents. These fees
cannot be reduced.</p>

<p>These fees cover the cost to the Red Cross of postage,
certificates, medals, bars, and so forth, but do not cover
that of instructor, examiner, or classroom supplies, which
the Red Cross requires the class to take care of.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>4. THE HOME NURSE</b></div>

<p>The Girl Scout who has earned the Home Nurse
Badge may be of great help where there is illness. But,
she should remember that only such people as doctors
and trained nurses who have knowledge and skill gained
by special training and thorough practice are fitted to
care properly for those who are very ill.</p>

<p>If the Scout with the badge keeps her head and shows
herself steady, reliable and willing, when called upon
for help in illness or emergencies, she proves herself a
true Scout who is living up to the Scout motto of "BE
PREPARED."</p>

<p>To earn the badge she should know:</p>

<p>How to keep the sick room clean and comfortable.</p>

<p>How to make a bed properly.</p>

<p>How to prepare for and help a sick person in taking
a bath.</p>

<p>How to make a sick person comfortable in bed, changing
position, etc.</p>

<p>How to take temperature, pulse and respiration.</p>

<p>How to prepare and serve simple, nourishing food for
the sick.</p>

<p>How to feed a helpless person.</p>

<p>How to prepare and use simple remedies for slight ailments.</p>

<p>How to occupy and amuse the sick.</p>

<p>When helping about the sick, the Scout should wear a
wash dress or an apron which covers her dress. She
should be very neat and clean. She should wash her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
hands frequently, <i>always</i> before her own meals, and
after coming into contact with the sick person and after
handling utensils, dishes, linen, etc., used in the sick
room. Great cleanliness is necessary not only for her
own protection but to prevent illness spreading.</p>

<p>She should move quickly and quietly, but without
bustle or hurry, taking care not to let things fall, not to
bump against the furniture, not to jar the bed, not to
slam doors, in fact not to make any unnecessary noises,
as sick people are not only disturbed but may be made
worse by noises and confusion. If a door is squeaky the
hinges should be oiled. Too much talking, loud talking
and whispering are to be avoided. Only cheerful and
pleasant subjects should be talked of, <i>never</i> illnesses
either that of the patient nor of others.</p>

<p>The best nursing aims not only to bring relief and comfort
to those already sick, but to guard against <i>spreading</i>
sickness.</p>

<p>We know, now, that many diseases are spread by
means of <i>germs</i> which are carried from person to person
by various means, such as air, water, milk, and other
food; discharges from the mouth, nose, bowels, bladder,
wounds; clothing; the hands; the breath, and so forth.</p>

<p>It has been found that great heat, intense cold, sunshine
and some powerful drugs called disinfectants kill
germs. Germs thrive and multiply in dirt, dampness and
darkness. That is why it is important to have fresh
air, sunshine and cleanliness in order to keep well, and
to help in curing those who get sick.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Room, Its Order and Arrangement</b></div>

<p>The hangings and furniture of a sick room should be
of a kind that can be washed and easily kept clean. Plain
wooden furniture is better than upholstered furniture
which collects and holds the dust. If there is a rocking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
chair it should be for the use of the sick person only.
Seeing and hearing other people rock may be very disturbing.</p>

<p>If carpets are movable, so much the better, as they can
be taken out to be cleaned.</p>

<p>The room should be bright and attractive. Sick people
like flowers and pretty things, but the flowers should not
have a strong perfume, and there should not be too
many ornaments around to collect dust and to take up
too much room. Flowers should be taken out of the
room every night and the water changed before <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">being</ins> returned
to the room in the morning. Never have faded flowers
around.</p>

<p>The room should be kept neat&mdash;a place for everything
and everything in its place.</p>

<p>Neatness and attractiveness are not only pleasing to
the sick person and those who come into the room but
may really make the sick person feel better.</p>

<p>Medicines should not be kept in sight. All dishes and
utensils not in use should be taken away and should be
washed immediately after use.</p>


<p><i>Ventilating and Lighting the Room</i></p>

<p>The room of a sick person should be so situated that
it will get plenty of sunlight and be easily aired. A room
that has two or more windows can be better ventilated
than a room with only one. When there is only one window,
it should be opened both top and bottom. If there
is not a screen, one can be made by hanging a shawl or
a blanket over a clothes horse or a high-backed chair, or
over a line stretched across the lower part of the window.
A fire place or a stove keeps the air circulating&mdash;the air
being constantly drawn up the chimney&mdash;and so helps in
ventilating a room.</p>

<p>When "airing" the room great care must be taken to
keep the sick person free from draughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Unless special orders have been given to the contrary
there should be plenty of sunshine let in. The eyes of
the sick person should be protected from the glare by a
screen.</p>

<p>If possible there should be a thermometer in the room.
The proper heat is between 65 and 70 degrees. If the
temperature of the room is as high as 70 degrees and the
sick person is cold, it is better to give her a hot water bag
and to put on more covers than to shut the windows, thus
keeping out the fresh air. Cool air acts as a tonic for
the sick.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Cleaning the Room</b></div>

<p>The carpet should be gone over every day to remove
the surface dust. Use the carpet sweeper, being careful
not to knock the furniture nor to jar the bed. Raise
as little dust and make as little noise as possible. Torn-up
wet paper scattered on a small part of the carpet at
a time and lightly brushed up into a dustpan with a whisk
broom, or a broom, cleans the carpet very well without
raising dust.</p>

<p>If the carpet cannot be taken out to be swept or beaten
but requires thorough sweeping, an umbrella with a sheet
over it may be hoisted over the head of the sick person
to keep the dust from her nose and nostrils. The bare
parts of the floor should be gone over with a damp duster
or a damp mop.</p>

<p>The dusting should be done with a damp or oiled duster
also, so that the dust may not be scattered. A basin of
soapy water should be at hand and the duster washed in
it frequently while dusting, so that the dust collected on
it from one surface will not be carried to another. While
dusting special attention should be paid to the doorknobs
and that part of the door around them.</p>

<p>When the dusting is finished the dusters should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thoroughly washed and scalded and hung out of doors
to dry.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Bed</b></div>

<p>A metal bedstead is better than a wooden one, as wood
holds odors and moisture, and is apt to have more cracks
and crevices for germs or bugs to lodge in. It should be
white, for then it shows when it needs cleaning and bed
bugs keep away from white surfaces which show them
up easily.</p>

<p>If possible, have the bed in a part of the room, where
the drafts will not strike the patient every time a door
or window is opened, and where the light does not shine
in the eyes. If it can be placed so that the patient can
see from the window so much the better.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Make an Unoccupied Bed</b></div>

<p>Remove pillows and bedclothes, one at a time, being
careful not to let corners drag on the floor, and put to
air. Turn the mattress over from end to end one day,
and from side to side next day. If the patient does not
have to return to bed at once leave to air for at least half
an hour.</p>

<p>An old blanket, old spread or a quilted pad, spread over
the mattress not only protects the mattress but prevents
the sheets from wearing out, and may make the bed more
comfortable. These should be kept clean.</p>

<p>The bed for a sick person is frequently made with a
rubber sheet and a draw sheet. The draw sheet is so
called because its proper use is to be drawn through under
the patient without greatly disturbing her and give her
a cool fresh place to lie on. Therefore it should be long
enough to tuck in sufficiently under one side to allow
of this being done. An ordinary sheet folded in two
from top to bottom and placed with folded edge toward
the head of the bed may be used. It should entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
cover the rubber sheet, which is usually put on between
the bottom and the draw sheet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i032.png" width="500" height="410" alt="How to set up the bed" title="" />
</div>

<p>When the mattress is sufficiently aired, put on the protective
covering. Over this spread the lower sheet so
that the middle fold of the sheet lies up and down the
centre of the mattress from head to foot. Keep perfectly
straight. The sheet should be long enough to
have at least fourteen inches over at ends and sides to
tuck in. Tuck ends under mattress at head and foot
drawing tightly so that it will be smooth and firm. Now
tuck under at one side, folding neatly at corners, so that
they will be mitred when finished. If there is no rubber
nor draw sheet to put on, go to the other side of the bed
and tuck in firmly at corners. Then, pulling the middle of
the sheet very tightly with one hand, push the mattress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
with the other and tuck the sheet under. This under
sheet should be very smooth without a wrinkle in it. If
it is not long enough to tuck in well at both head and
foot, leave plenty at the head to tuck in securely and
tuck in at the sides tightly rather than risk having it
come loose at the head. Be sure, however, that the mattress
is entirely covered.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>When Rubber and Draw Sheets Are Used</b></div>

<p>Before going around to the other side, lay the rubber
sheet over the bed, so that the top edge will be well above
where the lower edge of the pillow will come. Put the
draw sheet over it. Tuck both well under the mattress on
that side. Then, go to the other side and tuck in the
corners of the lower sheet as directed, then stretching
draw, rubber, and under sheet very tightly, tuck in
separately.</p>

<p>Next spread the upper sheet, wrong side up, leaving as
much at the head to turn back over the blankets as you
left in the under sheet to tuck in. Have the middle fold
over that of the lower sheet. Spread the blankets so
that their upper edges will be even with the upper edge
of the mattress. If the blankets are not long enough to
reach as far up as they should, and yet tuck under firmly
at the foot, place the lower one as directed, and the upper
one so that there will be enough to tuck under at the foot,
and hold the others in place. Tuck in all at once the foot
and lower corners, mitring the corners as you did those
of the lower sheet. Pull and straighten the sheet at the
top and turn back smoothly over the blankets. If the bed
is not to be occupied right away, tuck in both sides,
stretching well so that it will have a smooth surface. Put
on the spread, having the top edge even with the top of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>the covers. Tuck in neatly at foot and lower corners,
letting the sides hang. Shake and beat the pillows thoroughly,
make smooth and even, and put in place.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Change the Under Sheet When the Patient Is
in Bed</b></div>

<p>Loosen the bedclothes, without jarring the bed. Take
off covers one at a time, until only one blanket and sheet
remain. (If the patient feels cold, leave as many blankets
as necessary to keep her warm.) Holding blankets with
one hand or having patient hold it by the top, draw off
the upper sheet, being careful not to uncover the patient.
Remove the pillows. Have the patient as near the
side of the bed as is safe, on her side, and facing the
side on which she is lying. Roll the under sheets on the
side of the bed close to the patient's back, making them
as flat as possible. Pleat about half of the fresh under
sheet lengthwise, and place close to the soiled sheets.
Tuck in the other half, at the head, foot and side, draw
the rubber sheet back over this fresh sheet, arrange the
fresh draw sheet in place, tuck both in at that side and
roll the free part close up to the patient's back. Now
lift the patient's feet over the roll of fresh and soiled
linen to the freshly made part, then have her roll her body
over that side. Going to the other side of the bed, remove
all the soiled linen and tuck the fresh sheets in,
pulling tightly, being sure that there are no wrinkles under
the patient. All the time keep the patient well covered.
Now, spread the upper sheet and blankets over the covering
the patient has had on while the lower sheets were
being changed and, having the patient hold the coverings
you have just put on, draw off the others, just as you
took off the top sheet at first. Finish making the bed
as you would an unoccupied one.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>If the Bed Is to Be Occupied at Once</b></div>

<p>If the bed is to be occupied at once the coverings should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
be tucked in only at foot, corners and one side, then
turned back diagonally from the head to foot.</p>

<p>The bed clothes should never be drawn too tightly over
a person in bed, or they may irritate the skin, especially
at the knees and toes. Bed sores may be started in this
way. Perhaps the commonest cause of bedsores is from
wrinkles in the under sheets. If the spread is heavy it
should not be used over a patient. Use a sheet instead to
protect the blankets.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Bathing</b></div>

<p>Bathing is more important for the sick than for the
well. It not only keeps the skin clean and in condition
to do its work, but it is soothing to the nerves, makes
the sick person rest better and is refreshing.</p>

<p>If the room is the right temperature and the bath is
carefully taken there is no danger of a sick person taking
cold. On the other hand bathing helps to keep people in
condition to <i>avoid</i> taking colds. (See Red Cross Text
Book on Home Hygiene and Care of the Sick, page 156.)</p>

<p>When a patient is very sick or helpless, the bath should
be given by someone who is able to do it deftly and quickly,
with the least exertion to the patient.</p>

<p>Very often, however, a person in bed is quite able to
bathe herself, with a little help, if the necessary things
are brought to her.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Prepare For a Bath in Bed</b></div>

<p>Have the room warm and free from draughts. A good
temperature is 70 degrees. An old person or a baby may
have it warmer.</p>

<p>Bring into the room everything needed. This will include:</p>

<p>An extra blanket to wrap around the sick person.</p>

<p>Two or more bath towels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Two wash cloths&mdash;one for the face and another for the
rest of the body.</p>

<p>Soap&mdash;Ivory or castile are good.</p>

<p>Pitcher of good hot water, and slop jar.</p>

<p>Alcohol and toilet powder if you have it.</p>

<p>Nail file and scissors.</p>

<p>Comb and brush.</p>

<p>Clean bed linen and nightgown. In cold weather these
may be hung near the fire or radiator to warm.</p>

<p>A basin of water of a temperature that the sick person
finds comfortable.</p>

<p>When everything is ready the Scout can help by loosening
the bedclothes, arranging the extra blanket, removing
the nightgown, and in holding the basin and towels, in
changing the water or in any way that will make the bath
easier for the sick person, perhaps washing the feet
and back, being careful to keep all the rest of the body
covered and warm, and in protecting the bed by bath
towels spread under the part being washed. When doing
this the wash cloth should not be so wet that it will drip
and wet the bed. It should be held so that the corners do
not touch against the bedclothes. There should not be
too much soap used as it makes the skin feel sticky.
Every part should be rinsed and dried thoroughly. Warm
towels are a great help in this.</p>

<p>When the bath is finished alcohol or witch hazel may
be used to rub the parts where there is most pressure
as the back, shoulder blades, hips, buttocks, elbows, knees
and ankles. This not only gives comfort but it prevents
bedsores.</p>

<p>If a sick person gets a bath, so that it does not disturb
nor tire her nor make her chilly she will usually enjoy it.
By getting everything ready, by helping where needed,
and by clearing up nicely the Girl Scout may make the
bath a pleasure instead of something to be dreaded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes sick people are able to go to the bathroom
to take their own baths, if everything is gotten ready for
them beforehand, so that they will not get tired doing so.
People who are not well should never be allowed to lock
themselves in the bathroom alone.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Getting Ready a Tub Bath</b></div>

<p>The bathroom should be well aired but warm. The
water in the bath tub helps to warm it up. A bath towel
or bath mat should be spread beside the tub on the floor
and a chair with a blanket and a bath towel on it for
the person to sit on while she is drying herself. The
water should be about 105 degrees or a temperature that
the person finds comfortable. Always let a patient try it
herself with her hand and arm before getting in. Five
to ten minutes is long enough to stay in the water. The
towels should be within easy reach and the bathrobe,
night gown and slippers placed ready to put on.</p>

<p>The bed should be put to air and left as long as possible,
but if the patient has to get back in it immediately
after her bath, it should be made&mdash;care being taken that
it is warm enough. If necessary put in hot water bags
and spread a blanket over the under sheet to wrap around
her if she needs it. People chill easily after a bath if
they are exposed to sudden cold.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Foot Baths</b></div>

<p>Foot baths are often used in the home as remedies
for colds, headaches, sleeplessness and to give relief at
the monthly period.</p>

<p>If there is not a regular foot tub a pail that is large
enough to put the foot in is better than a basin as it
lets the water come up around the ankles. A person may
sit in a chair or on the side of the bed. Have tub about
half full of water and at first of a heat that feels com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>fortable,
putting more hot water in from time to time,
until it is as hot as it can be stood. When adding hot
water the feet should be away from the part of the tub
where the water is poured in, and it should be added
slowly to prevent possibility of burning. A person getting
a foot bath should be kept very warm. Wrap a
blanket around the knees so that the legs will be protected
front and back. After fifteen or twenty minutes
the feet should be removed from the water and dried
without rubbing. They should be kept well covered for
an hour or more. No one should go out immediately after
a foot bath.</p>

<p>If mustard is to be added, mix it first in a cup and mix
it gradually so that it does not lump. Two tablespoonfuls
of mustard to a foot bath is about enough.</p>

<p><i>Changing of position</i>, and supporting different parts of
the body, give both rest and comfort to anyone in bed.
This may be done by turning a patient and by the proper
arrangement of pillows and other supports.</p>

<p><i>To turn a patient toward you</i> place one hand over her
shoulder and the other hand over her hip and draw toward
you. Bend her knees, go to the other side of the
bed, put both hands under her hips and draw toward you.
Place a pillow lengthwise at her back, from her shoulder
to waist for support.</p>

<p>A pillow, placed under or between the knees, often
gives much relief and comfort. Small air pillows that
can be placed under or against the small of the back
relieve strain and rest the muscles. Anyone lying on
her back will be rested by arranging pillows lengthwise
at the sides to support arms. Rubber rings and air
cushions are also used to relieve pressure and give support.
They should always be covered, using towel or
pillow case, if they have not their own fitted covers.</p>

<p>Rings of any size may be made of cotton wound with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
bandage. These are frequently needed under the heels,
particularly for a patient lying on her back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" width="350" height="282" alt="Turning the patient" title="" />
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Sitting Up in Bed</b></div>

<p>When a patient is allowed to sit up in bed and a bed-rest
is not available a straight chair placed bottom-up behind
the patient makes a good support for the pillows.
If there is no other support, at least six pillows are
needed to make a patient comfortable. The pillows
should be so arranged that the head is not thrown forward
and that there is proper support for the back, and
the arms.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Raising a Patient Who Has Slipped Down in Bed</b></div>

<p>Have the patient draw up the knees until the soles of
the feet are firmly on the bed. Place your right arm under
the far shoulder in such a way that the patient's head
rests in your bent elbow. Place the left arm under the
thighs. Hold your back stiff. Have the patient clasp her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
hands around your waist. Lift without jerking. When
<i>two</i> persons are doing the lifting, one should stand on
either side of the bed. The person on the left side of the
bed should place the right arm as though she were doing
the lifting alone. Place the other arm under the small
of the patient's back.</p>

<p>The person on the right side will place her left arm
beside her companion's, and her right arm under the
thighs. If able, the patient may place a hand on the
shoulder of each lifter.</p>

<p>Lift in unison without jerking.</p>

<p>A pillow rolled in a sheet, placed under the body and
tied to the head or sides of the bed will prevent slipping
down in bed.</p>

<p>It is usually better to shake up and rearrange the
pillows after raising the patient as the moving disarranges
them somewhat.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Change the Pillows</b></div>

<p>Slip the right arm under the shoulders in such a way
that the neck and head are supported in your bent elbow;
with the left hand gently draw out one pillow at a time,
from above. In replacing, stand the pillows on the side
at the head of the bed, lift the shoulders, and grasping the
pillow by the middle draw down under the patient's
head.</p>

<p>Another way is to have the patient near one side of
the bed and lifting in the same way draw the pillows one
at a time away from you. In replacing put the fresh pillows
on the far side and again lifting the head pull them
toward you.</p>

<p>The pillow should support the neck and shoulders. A
small down or hair pillow placed under the back of the
neck from time to time, rests and supports.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Change the Nightgown</b></div>

<p>The nightgown should be loose enough to change easily.
If there is an opening in the front, this may be made
larger or the gown may be split up the back.</p>

<p>These openings may be sewn up again without in any
way damaging the gown.</p>

<p>Have the gown well drawn up around the shoulders
and neck.</p>

<p>Slip one hand through the arm hole of the gown, and
bend the patient's arm. With the other hand draw off
the sleeve.</p>

<p>Draw the hand through the corresponding sleeve of
the fresh gown and lifting the head just as for changing
the pillow, slip the soiled and fresh gown over the head
at the same time. Pull away the soiled gown. Put your
hand through the sleeve and draw the patient's hand
through, then raising again draw the gown down under
the back and hips.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Combing the Hair</b></div>

<p>The hair should be combed at least once a day. If
this is done from the very beginning of an illness it will
not get badly tangled.</p>

<p>Spread a towel over the pillow. Have the patient turn
head on one side so that the back of the head is exposed.
Part the hair in the middle from the forehead to the
nape of the neck. Comb only a small strand at a time.
If there are tangles, comb from ends toward the scalp.
Avoid pulling by twisting the strand around the finger
and holding loosely between the comb and the scalp.
When the hair on one side has been combed, braid it,
having the top of the braid near the ear. Do the other
side the same way. If very much tangled a little oil or
alcohol rubbed in makes it easier to comb.</p>

<p>Wash the comb and brush in soap and water once a
week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Wash the hands after combing the hair.</p>

<p>Be careful in removing the towel not to scatter the
loose hairs and dandruff it may hold.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Getting Patient Up in Chair</b></div>

<p>If possible have a chair with arms.</p>

<p>Place beside the bed.</p>

<p>Put cushions on seat and fresh pillow at back.</p>

<p>Throw a blanket over all corner-wise, to wrap around
the patient when she sits down.</p>

<p>While in bed put on stockings, slippers, bath robe (and
underdrawers or flannel petticoat in winter).</p>

<p>Have the patient sit up in bed, and help her to swing
her feet over the edge.</p>

<p>Stand in front of her, and have her place her hands on
your shoulders. Place your hands under her armpits,
and let her slip off the bed with her feet firmly on the
floor. Turn and let her sit down slowly.</p>

<p>Place a stool for her feet.</p>

<p>Place the chair so that she will be out of drafts and
so that the light does not shine directly into her face.</p>

<p>When patients become restless and nervous they may
often be made more comfortable by rearranging the
bed clothes, by fanning, by changing position, by rubbing
the back and legs, by putting hot water bags at the feet,
back and neck, or small of back. In summer try very
cold water instead of hot water in the bags. Cold compresses
may be applied to the back of the neck, the spine,
the forehead, or wherever they may give comfort. A
foot bath, a hot or cool sponging will not only quiet restlessness
but will often make a patient sleepy. In using
any wet application be sure not to get the pillows or bed
clothes wet. Continued rubbing at the back of the neck
or stroking of the forehead gently is soothing and quieting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Temperature, Pulse, Respiration</b></div>

<p>The temperature of the average person in health is
98.6&deg; Fahrenheit. This is called the <i>normal</i> temperature.</p>

<p>A temperature below 98.0 degrees is said to be sub-normal.
A healthy person may have a sub-normal temperature
in the early morning. People with a continuous
low temperature, say around 97 (this is often the case
with old people and those who are recovering from illness)
need careful attention. If in bed, they should be
kept warmly covered and supplied with hot water bags.
If up, they should be warmly clothed, and protected
from drafts, and sudden changes of temperature.
Usually, in the early morning before daylight, the temperature
is at the lowest. That is why it is important to
watch sick people and babies and to put an extra cover
over them at that time.</p>

<p>Any temperature above 100 degrees, if it continues, is
serious. A temperature above 101 degrees is a fairly
high one, and 103 degrees or above is very high.</p>

<p>The temperature is taken with a clinical thermometer
placed in the mouth or in the armpit. For babies, and
people who might break the thermometer if it were
placed in the mouth, place the thermometer in the armpit.
Temperatures of babies and very ill people are taken in
rectum, but the Girl Scout should not attempt this. Always
wash the thermometer in cold water before using.
Wash in cold water and disinfect by wiping off with alcohol
or ether after using. Hot water will break it. When
the thermometer is being used every day it may be kept in
disinfectant. Never lay down a thermometer that has
been used until after it has been washed and disinfected.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Take the Temperature in the Mouth</b></div>

<p>Cleanse the thermometer.</p>

<p>Shake down so that the mercury is below 96 degrees.</p>

<p>Have patient moisten lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Place the thermometer with bulb under tongue. Lips
must be closed while holding it.</p>

<p>Hold two or three minutes, in this position.</p>

<p>Be sure that nothing hot or cold has been in the mouth
for at least five minutes before taking temperature.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>To Take Temperature in the Armpits</b></div>

<p>Wipe out armpit.</p>

<p>Insert the thermometer.</p>

<p>Place arm across the chest so that the thermometer is
held securely. It should remain so for four or five
minutes.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Pulse</b></div>

<p>The pulse may be counted on the thumb side of the
inside of the wrist, at the temples, the ankles, and other
parts of the body where the arteries are near the surface.</p>

<p>The pulse shows the number of times per minute which
the heart beats or pumps.</p>

<p>A normal pulse rate for a man is around 72, for a
woman 80, for a child 90, and for a baby 100 beats.</p>

<p>A very rapid or a very slow pulse shows that there is
something wrong that should be reported. It takes a
good deal of practice to learn to count the pulse.</p>

<p>Place two or three fingers on the beating artery, just
touching firmly enough to feel the beats, and count for
a half minute, then multiply by two to find the number
of beats per minute. Be sure that the patient's hand is
in a comfortable position while counting.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Respiration</b></div>

<p>Respiration is another word for breathing. An average
normal person when sitting or lying still, breathes
from twelve to twenty times per minute, and when moving
about 24 times. We all know that quick moving
makes quick breathing.</p>

<p>Respiration above 40 or below 8 is a danger sign. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the respiration is very fast, or difficult, or wheezy, or in
any way very unusual, we can tell it at a glance. People
who are breathing hard are frequently relieved by being
propped up in bed.</p>

<p><i>To count the respiration.</i> It is better to do this without
the person's knowledge. It may be counted by watching
the rise and fall of the chest or of the shoulders. Another
way is to hold the person's hand as though taking
the pulse, having her rest her hand and forearm lightly
on the chest and count the rise and fall.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Dishes</b></div>

<p>Dishes used by patients with any of the contagious
diseases, and this includes colds and sore throats, should
be kept separate, and washed separately from the family
dishes. They should be scalded after washing and have
special dish cloths. Using separate utensils, and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word">a</ins> separate
room for the sick person are two of the surest ways to
prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>In such diseases as measles, scarlet fever, colds, mumps,
influenza, dishes should be boiled every day. Put them
in a large kettle in cold water and let them come to a
boil. Even the thinnest glass will not break if treated
in this way. Let the dishes stay in the water until cool
enough to handle.</p>

<p>Dish cloths and dish mops should be thoroughly washed
in good hot water and soap, and put in the sun to dry.
They should be boiled regularly.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to disinfect linen put it all in a bag
and leave in cold water to soak for some hours before
putting it on to boil. Put a little washing soda in the
water. After boiling hard for fifteen or twenty minutes
it may be washed with the other garments.</p>

<p>Stains should be washed out before putting linen in
the wash.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Utensils and Their Care</b></div>

<p><i>All utensils should be kept clean and ready for instant
use.</i> The bedpan should always be warmed before being
used. Running warm water in and on it is usually
the easiest way to do this. It should be thoroughly dried
on the outside so that it will not wet the bed. It is a
good plan to have a piece of rubber sheet or several
thicknesses of old newspapers covered with a bath towel
to put under the bedpan in bed. When carrying away,
keep covered. Use cold water first, and after washing
with soapy water, rinse and dry before putting away.</p>

<p>Basins in constant use, especially if they are used to
hold disinfectant, need to be well scoured with sapolio
from time to time. Nothing is more shiftless looking
than a dark rim of dirt or stain around a basin.</p>

<p>Hot water bags should be emptied when not in use
and hung upside down. The stoppers should be kept
fastened to them.</p>

<p>Ice caps should be dried inside and out and stuffed with
cotton or tissue paper to keep the sides from sticking
together.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Hot and Cold Applications</b></div>

<p>Hot applications are used to relieve pain, to supply
heat, and to bring down temperature. Both moist and
dry heat are used. Hot water bags, metal heaters, electric
pads, hot flannels are the commonest forms of dry heat.
Fomentations, poultices, and baths are the simplest forms
of moist heat.</p>

<p>In applying heat, one should be ever on the watch
to avoid burning a patient. The skin of babies, children,
old people, and of those who have been ill a long time, is
very easily burned. Again, the same heat that is easily
tolerated by one person, may burn another.</p>

<p><i>Hot water bags</i> or their substitute, electric pads or
metal heaters should always be wrapped in towels or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
have their own coverings. Never fill a hot water bag
more than two-thirds full. The water should not be
hot enough to scald a patient if the bag should spring a
leak. Before putting in the cork, expel the air by twisting
the upper part between the neck and the level of the
water before putting in the cork. Be sure to cork tightly.
If the bag is to be where the patient will bear the weight,
put in a very little water and renew from time to time.
Where there is no hot water bag, stone bottles may be
used, or bags of salt or sand may be heated in the oven.
The practice of using ordinary glass bottles is an unsafe
one, as the corks are not always to be depended on
to stay tight and the glass breaks easily. When bags
of salt or sand are used the coverings should be thick
enough to prevent the particles from sifting through.
Pieces of flannel the right size may in some cases supply
all the heat that is necessary. They should be covered
with another flannel to keep in the warmth.</p>

<p><i>To make a mustard plaster.</i> Have ready a piece of
old muslin (a piece of an old nightgown will do) two
inches wide and two inches longer than twice the length
of the poultice required. On one end of it, with a margin
of an inch on three sides, place a piece of oiled paper
or shelf paper or a piece of clean paper bag, the size you
wish the poultice to be. Mix one tablespoonful of mustard
with 8 tablespoonfuls of flour, before wetting.
Have water about as hot as the hand can stand. Do not
use boiling water. Stir the water into the mustard and
flour gradually so that it will not lump. Make the paste
stiff enough to spread thinly on the paper, about a quarter
of an inch thick. Turn the margins of the cloth over
the paste. Fold the long end over so that all the paste is
covered and tuck the end under the turned-in edges of
the sides. Fold it and take it to the patient in a hot towel
or between hot plates. The skin where it is to be placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
should be oiled. Test the heat by holding it against the
back of your own hand. Put on slowly and leave for two
minutes. Watch and remove sooner if the skin becomes
reddened or if it is uncomfortable. After removing wipe
away the moisture from the skin and cover with a soft
piece of muslin, and place a piece of flannel over that.
A blister after a mustard paste shows very careless nursing.
Never let a patient go to sleep with a mustard
plaster on.</p>

<span class="caption">ADMINISTERING AN INHALATION</span>
</div>

<p><i><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fomentation'">Fomentations</ins> or stupes</i> are pieces of flannel wrung
out of very hot water and placed on the skin. They
should be two or three times as large as the part to be
treated, and should be applied as hot as the patient can
bear them, without burning the skin. Have two sets,
so that one set will be ready to put on when the other
is taken off. The stupes should be wrung as dry as
possible and as they must be very hot to do any good,
a fomentation wringer is a great protection for the
hands. One may be made by putting halves of a broom
handle through the ends of a short roller towel in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
middle of which the fomentation has been placed. By
twisting the sticks in the opposite direction the fomentation
can be wrung very dry. Take it to the bed in the
wringer and do not open until ready to place on the
skin, as it will lose its heat very quickly. Put a little oil
or vaseline on the skin and apply the fomentation gradually.
Cover with a dry flannel and put wadding over
that. A piece of oiled skin or oiled paper between the
wadding and the dry flannel helps to keep in the heat and
moisture. Hold in place with a towel or binder pinned
tightly.</p>

<p><i>Cold</i> is applied by means of ice bags and by cold
compresses. In filling an ice bag the ice should be in
small pieces, and the bag not too full. Expel the air
as from a hot water bag. Cover with a towel or a
cover for the purpose. Never put the rubber near the
skin, it may freeze if so left. Besides, the cover absorbs
the moisture that collects on the outside as the
ice melts.</p>

<p><i>Cold compresses</i> are a common remedy for headache.
Old handkerchiefs are excellent for this purpose. Fold
in frayed edges, two or three thicknesses will be heavy
enough, and have two, large enough to cover the forehead.
Wring one out of ice water so that it will not
drip, and put on the forehead. Keep the other on a
piece of ice and change the two applications frequently.
When applied to the neck a dry cloth should be placed
outside to protect the pillow or the patient's clothing.
Cold compresses for inflamed eyes should be of one
thickness only, and a little larger than the eye. Have a
number and change very often. Use a separate compress
for each eye. If there is a discharge a compress
should not be used a second time. The discarded compresses
should be collected in a paper bag or wrapped in
newspapers and burned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>When cold compresses are applied to the head there
should be a hot water bag at the feet.</p>

<p><i>Gargles, sprays, and inhalations</i> are often ordered for
sore throats and colds.</p>

<p>Salt or soda added to water in the proportion of a teaspoonful
to a pint makes an excellent gargle.</p>

<p>A very cold gargle or one as hot as can be held without
burning is better than a tepid one.</p>

<p>Do not go out in the cold air directly after using a
hot gargle.</p>

<p>Use at least six separate mouthfuls each time you
gargle, and hold long enough at the back of the throat
for the gargle to reach every part.</p>

<p>A spray should not be used for the nose without a
special order from the doctor. The liquid sometimes
gets into the passage leading to the ear and causes earache.</p>

<p>Always wipe the nozzle of the atomizer before using.
It should be cleaned after each use and boiled, if another
patient is to use it. Always boil the nozzle and
clean out the bottle when the atomizer is to be put away.
Keep it in a box where dust will not reach it.</p>

<p><i>Inhalations</i> are useful to relieve difficult breathing
and for loss of voice or hoarseness. Fill a pitcher, bowl,
or basin, two-thirds full of boiling water. Wrap with
a towel to prevent burning if it should touch a patient.
Usually drugs such as peppermint spirits, oil of eucalyptus,
or tincture of benzoin, in dose of a teaspoonful to
the hot water contained in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'receptable'">receptacle</ins>, is enough. If
no drug is at hand, the steam itself may be depended upon
to do some good. Pin one end of a bath towel around the
face below the eyes and spread the other over the pitcher
inhaling the steam as it rises. It may not be possible
to induce a child to do this, in which case make a tent
of an open umbrella with a sheet thrown over it at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
head of the bed, leaving the front a little open. Place
the pitcher so that the child will get the steam and hold
the pitcher carefully all the time. Do not let the pitcher
touch the patient.</p>

<p>Another means of inhalation is to hold a funnel, made
of a piece of folded paper in the nose of a kettle of very
hot water, near the patient so that the steam can be inhaled.
Be very careful not to scald the patient. After
a steam inhalation one should not go out in the cold
air nor have the windows opened for an hour or more.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Common Medicines and Other Remedies</b></div>

<p>It is a very safe rule <i>never</i> to take medicines oneself
without a doctor's orders. Above all, never advise others,
even when you know from experience that certain medicines
have helped yourself and others. Medicines should
be taken upon prescription from the physician, should
be measured accurately, and given at the exact hour
ordered.</p>

<p>Read carefully the label or box from which you take
the medicine before and after opening or uncorking,
and read the name again when putting back in its place.
Many people have been poisoned by not reading the
label. Have all glasses and spoons, etc., thoroughly
cleansed before and after using.</p>

<p>Accuracy, attention, cleanliness, regularity should be
watchwords.</p>

<p>In giving either food or medicine, the following measures
are helpful:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Helpful measures">
<tr><td align='right'>1</td><td align='left'>&nbsp;teaspoonful measures 50 grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>2</td><td align='left'>&nbsp;teaspoonfuls make 1 dessertspoonful.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>2</td><td align='left'>&nbsp;dessertspoonfuls make 1 tablespoonful.</td></tr>

<tr><td align='right'>&nbsp;</td><td align='left'>&nbsp;&nbsp;(This applies to either liquid or dry measure.)</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>In giving pills, capsules, tablets give a drink of water
first to moisten the tongue and throat. This helps them
to slip down more easily.</p>

<p>If there is danger of a pill or tablet choking the patient,
crush the pill or tablet between two spoons.</p>

<p>When medicines are taken by spoon, the spoon should
be licked by the patient in order to get the full amount.</p>

<p>Nearly all medicines should be mixed with water, and
should be followed with a drink of water unless orders
are given to the contrary.</p>

<p>Keep all medicines tightly corked.</p>

<p>Buy medicines only in small quantities, as most of
them lose their strength in time.</p>

<p>In buying vaseline or cold cream it is better to have
it in a tube than in jars. Being opened and dipped into
constantly soon makes the contents of a jar unclean.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Common Remedies</b></div>

<p>Such remedies as the following are to be found in
many homes.</p>

<p>Castor oil, clove oil, vaseline, baking soda (this is
the same thing as bicarbonate of soda or saleratus), salt,
lime water, alcohol, camphorated oil, spirits of camphor,
flaxseed, aromatic spirits of ammonia. Do not confuse
this latter remedy with ammonia water used for cleansing
things.</p>

<p>Castor oil should be taken in these doses:</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Castor oil doses">
<tr><td align='left'>Baby: 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Older children: 1 tablespoonful.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Adult: 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>There are many ways of taking castor oil. Heat the
glass or spoon, put in some orange or lemon juice, then
the oil, then more juice. Open the mouth wide and put
the oil far back. Have more juice at hand to swallow immediately
after. Chilling the mouth by holding a piece
of ice in it for a few minutes also helps to disguise the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
taste. A couple of tablespoonfuls of lemon or orange
juice with a quarter of a teaspoonful of soda mixed
thoroughly with the oil will make it effervesce so that
it is not unpleasant to take.</p>

<p>If the dose is vomited, wait a little while, then give
another. Do not give directly before nor directly after
a meal.</p>

<p><i>Olive oil</i> is often taken in doses of one or two teaspoonfuls
after meals to regulate the bowels or to help people
gain weight or when the appetite is small. It is also used
to rub into the skin of under-nourished babies and to rub
sick people, especially if the skin is very dry. After
rubbing with oil always wipe the skin with a towel.</p>

<p><i>Vaseline</i> is used to grease sore and chafed parts. A
little may be inserted into the nostrils for a cold. Camphorated
vaseline is especially good for this. In case of
an irritating cough that keeps a child from sleeping, a
little plain pure vaseline may be put in the mouth, and
it will be found very soothing.</p>

<p>Vaseline is also used to grease such utensils as nozzles
and to put on the parts to which poultices or fomentations
are to be applied.</p>

<p><i>Soda</i> may be used for burns (moisten and apply as a
paste), as a gargle (one teaspoonful to a pint of water),
as an enema (the same proportion), for colds (a teaspoonful
in a quart of water to be taken internally in the
course of each day), and in bilious attacks, water with
this amount of soda may be given. Also to get a person
to vomit, in which case the water should be slightly warm.</p>

<p><i>Salt</i> may be used as a gargle in the same way as soda,
and even mixed with soda, also for enemas. Coarse
salt, when heated and put into bags, may be used when
there is no hot water bag.</p>

<p><i>Lime water</i> is used in mixing the baby's milk and is
put in the milk for sick people when they cannot take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
full strength milk. The usual proportion is two tablespoons
of lime water to a half glass of milk, which makes
about 1 part of lime water to 3 parts of milk.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol</i> may be used to disinfect the more delicate
utensils as the thermometer. <i>Most alcohol now obtainable
is wood alcohol or denaturated; that is, mixed with
powerful poisons, so that it should never touch the
mouth.</i> Never place a bottle of alcohol near a flame.
If it is ever necessary to use an alcohol lamp, use the
solid alcohol. It is much safer.</p>

<p><i>Camphorated oil</i> is often used to rub the chest and
neck with in case of colds. It should be warmed and
rubbed in thoroughly. Protect the bedclothes and the
patient's clothes with towels. After rubbing, wipe and
cover the part with a flannel, to prevent chill.</p>

<p><i>Spirits of camphor or aromatic spirits of ammonia</i>,
a few drops on a handkerchief or piece of cotton, held
five or six inches from the nose, relieves faintness. Inhaling
the camphor in this way will often make it easier
to breathe through the nose in case of a head cold. Fifteen
drops of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a tablespoonful
of water may be given to anyone recovering
from a faint or to relieve nausea.</p>

<p><i>Flaxseed tea</i> is an old-fashioned remedy for coughs.
Pour a quart of boiling water over two tablespoonfuls
of flaxseed and let it simmer for two or three hours,
or until reduced to about a pint of tea. Strain through a
fine strainer several times so that it will not be stringy,
flavor with lemon, and add honey or sugar. Put in a
covered jar, and take a teaspoonful at a time to relieve
irritation in the throat.</p>

<p><i>The Daily Clean-Out.</i>&mdash;People, sick or well, should
have a bowel movement once or twice a day. Taking
medicine for this purpose is a very bad habit. If healthy
people have the proper exercise and food, and drink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
plenty of good water, medicine is not necessary. Eating
coarse grained food, as bran muffins, corn meal porridge,
fruits, and vegetables, drinking plenty of water, exercising
in the open air, and having a regular time for going
to the lavatory (immediately after breakfast and the last
thing at night before retiring are suggested times) are
habits that are usually sufficient to keep the bowels in
good order.</p>

<p>If the waste matter is not carried off by the bowel
movements, the body will in time become poisoned by the
decayed substance in the intestines, and illness follows.
Many headaches, "tired feelings," "blues," and even appendicitis
may be caused by constipation.</p>

<p>People who are sick and therefore deprived of taking
exercise to help in keeping their bowels regular, need to
have very special attention paid to their diet and to have
plenty of drinking water always at hand. Also they
should have bedpan or whatever other attention they
need <i>regularly</i>, and when asked for, <i>immediately</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chill</i>, if due to exposure, may be treated by giving a
warm bath or a foot bath, and putting to bed between
warm blankets and with hot water bags. Rub briskly
under the covers and give a warm drink such as tea,
coffee, milk, etc.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Some Common Ills and Their Treatment</b></div>

<p>When a chill is not merely due to being cold, give
the same treatment except the rubbing, take the temperature,
and if there is fever, send for the doctor, as it
may be the beginning of an illness.</p>

<p><i>Colds or cramps</i>, or pain in the bowels may be caused
by constipation, by gas, by undigested food, by the
monthly period or more serious causes. Apply heat (hot
water bag or fomentation), sip hot water in which is a
little baking soda (one-half teaspoonful to a cup), or a
few drops of peppermint. Try a hot foot bath. Lie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
down and keep very quiet with a hot water bag at feet.
If pain continues, except in the case of the monthly illness,
empty the stomach either by putting the finger
down the throat or by drinking warm water and soda
until vomiting starts. Take an enema or a dose of castor
oil. If the pain still continues, send for a doctor.</p>

<p><i>Convulsions.</i> Send for a doctor at once. Loosen all
clothing, undress if possible. Watch and prevent patient
from hurting herself. Do not try to restrain. Try to
force a spoonhandle wound with a bandage between the
teeth, to prevent biting of tongue. Keep lying down
with head slightly raised. As soon as possible, administer
enema or dose of castor oil. Put ice bag on
head and hot water bottle to feet. Keep warm. A child
may be put into a warm bath and held until convulsions
subside. Keep very quiet and handle as little as possible
when the convulsion is over, as handling may cause a
repetition of the twitching.</p>

<p><i>Croup.</i> Give steam inhalation. Keep a kettle of very
warm water in the room. If this is not possible, fill the
bathroom with steam by turning on the hot water, and
take the patient there. Put hot fomentations to neck,
chest, and abdomen. Send for doctor, who will usually
order medicine to make the child vomit, which brings
some relief.</p>

<p><i>Earache.</i> Use hot applications against the ear. A
heated glass or a cup in which there is a cloth wrung
in very hot water, held against the ear may be found
very comforting. Never put drops nor anything else
into the ear canal. Either send for the doctor or take
the patient to him, as there may be a developing abscess
which needs to be opened.</p>

<p><i>Fever.</i> Patient should go to bed in a well ventilated
room and keep quiet. The bowels should move freely
and plenty of water be taken. Bathing the hands, face
and neck or rubbing with alcohol gives relief, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
if there is restlessness. Only liquid food should be
given, and even that should not be urged.</p>

<p><i>Headaches.</i> The commonest causes of frequent headaches
are eye-strain and indigestion. The cure is being
fitted with glasses and taking a proper diet. Rest and
quiet, careful eating, cold compresses to the head, a hot
water bag to the feet, or a foot bath will usually relieve
an ordinary headache. Sometimes, as when there is
constipation, a dose of castor oil is necessary. An enema
will often give instant relief. Never take headache
medicines unless a doctor has specially ordered it. These
medicines may contain powerful poisons. The danger
of taking them is that while for the time being they may
relieve the headache, the <i>cause</i> of the headache <i>remains</i>,
and the headache returns unless the cause, such as eye-strain
or indigestion, is removed.</p>

<p><i>Hiccoughs</i> can be usually stopped by drinking a glass
of water in sips while holding the breath. They are
usually caused by eating too fast or by some form of
indigestion.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Colds, Their Prevention and Care</b></div>

<p>Everybody knows that colds are "catching." People
who are over-tired or under-fed, who stay too much in
either under-heated or over-heated rooms, or who do not
bathe regularly, or who do not get exercise enough in
the open air, are those most likely to catch cold.</p>

<p>If you have a cold yourself, stay away from others
if possible, and do all in your power to prevent others
coming close to you. Cover the mouth when coughing
or sneezing, use paper or old rags instead of handkerchiefs
and then burn them; wash your hands before
touching things others are to use, and use separate dishes,
which should be kept entirely apart from the family
dishes and washed separately. If such precautions are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
taken by the first member of the family to take cold, it
would seldom spread through the family.</p>

<p>When people around you have colds, avoid getting
close to them, gargle often, take deep breaths of fresh
air whenever possible, wash your hands often and keep
them away from your nose and mouth.</p>

<p>You do not need to be told that the handkerchief used
by anyone with a cold is full of germs. It should be
kept from touching other things and should never be
left lying around.</p>

<p>If, at the first signs of a cold, a good dose of castor
oil is taken, a glass of hot lemonade and a hot bath before
going to bed, a cold may be "broken up," as we say.
In mild weather, the windows may be left open, but if
the weather is very cold it is better to air the room from
another room, in order to keep an even temperature, but
there should be good ventilation.</p>

<p>If the throat is sore, gargling and a cold compress to
the neck will bring relief. If there is fever and headache,
you have already been told what to do. Anyone
with a cold should eat very lightly and drink plenty of
water. They should be as quiet as possible and get all
the rest and sleep possible.</p>

<p>Camphorated or plain vaseline may be put in the nostrils,
and if there is a cough, plain vaseline may be taken
internally&mdash;placed on the tongue at the back of the
mouth. A spoonful of flaxseed tea taken as often as
necessary to relieve irritation may bring relief. Inhalations
are helpful in hoarseness. Never give any cough
medicines except what are ordered by a doctor.</p>

<p>If the symptoms continue after the first night it is
advisable to call a doctor, as what seems a slight cold
may be the beginning of a serious illness, as measles,
scarlet fever, pneumonia, etc. If there is earache, rapid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
breathing, great weakness or sleepiness the doctor should
be called at once.</p>

<p>Any symptom that lasts after a cold, as pain in one
part, weakness, or high temperature, needs a doctor's
attention.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Food for the Sick</b></div>

<p>Food for the sick should be light and easily digested.
Generally the doctor says what may be eaten. Such
foods as the following are included in so-called invalid
foods: Milk, milk soups, eggs, raw and soft-cooked,
rennet, custards, ice creams, albumin water, well cooked
cereals, gruels, broths, toasts, milk toast, jellies made
with gelatine, such as lemon and wine jelly; macaroni,
spaghetti, well-cooked bread (never fresh bread), tea,
coffee, cocoa.</p>

<p>Sick people should have their meals as regularly as
possible, at regular hours and promptly and attractively
served. The tray, the dishes, the tray-cloth, should be
spotlessly clean, and the tray should not be over-loaded
with dishes or food. If it is necessary to bring all the
food for a meal to the room on the tray at once in order
to save steps, remove some of it, perhaps the dessert,
until the patient is ready for it.</p>

<p>Before leaving the room to prepare the tray, arrange
everything so that the patient may eat the food as soon
as it is brought. As a rule it is better for the sick member
of the family to have her meals served before the
family sits down to the table, so that she may have her
food fresh and hot, and not get tired waiting.</p>

<p>Try to have food that the patient likes, if possible. If
she does not like what may be served her, it may be
served so attractively that her appetite may be tempted.</p>

<p>All food should be tasted before serving. Serve hot
food hot, and cold food cold.</p>

<p>Milk is the most nourishing of liquid foods. If it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to be heated, do not let it boil. Always take the chill
off milk served to children.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, cooked food is better than uncooked,
even fruits. Baked apples or apple sauce, for
example, are safer to give the sick than raw apples.</p>

<p>Toast is better than bread. Toast upon which the
butter has melted should not be given to a sick person.
Have the toast hot, and butter each mouthful as eaten.
Bread should be at least one day old before <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original omits this word'">being</ins> given to a
sick person. Hot breads, such as fresh rolls and biscuits,
are not good foods for ill people. Fried foods should
be kept from invalids and children.</p>

<p>The best way to prepare a potato for an invalid is to
bake it. It should be served when it is light and mealy,
and never after it has become soggy.</p>

<p>The best way of cooking meat is to broil it, having
the outside well browned, and the inside soft and juicy,
never dry and hard.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>A Tray for Liquid and Soft Food</b></div>

<p>The tray should be large enough to hold two glasses
or a cup and saucer and a glass, as well as salt or sugar.
Put two spoons on the tray, and if the patient is using
a tube or a feeder, put that on the tray. One of the
glasses should contain fresh water. Offer a glass of
water before and after the nourishment.</p>

<p>The tray for soft solids. Suppose the meal is to be
boiled rice, or other cereal, and toast. The tray should
have a fresh doilie, salt, sugar (covered), a glass of
water, two teaspoons, a knife, if butter is allowed on the
toast, and a small pitcher of milk or cream for the rice.
Put the cereal in a deep saucer or small bowl, cover
with a plate or saucer and rest on another plate. Spread
a small napkin on another plate. Put the toast on it,
then wrap the napkin around it to keep hot.</p>

<p>Sick people should have plenty of water to drink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Besides having a pitcher of fresh water and a glass where
it may be easily reached, always put a glass of fresh
cool water on the tray when food or medicine are brought.
While ice water is bad for both sick and well people,
the water should be cool enough to be agreeable and
refreshing. Water that is chilled to the right temperature
by being kept in the ice chest, bottled, is preferable.
It should be drunk slowly and not gulped down. Water
standing in the room should be kept covered at all times.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Feeding Helpless Patients</b></div>

<p>A patient is often so weak that she cannot lift her
head in order to eat. In this case she would be given
liquids through straws or by spoon or "feeder." Sometimes
by putting a small quantity of liquid in a glass, two
tablespoonfuls, a patient is enabled to drink without
spilling a drop.</p>

<p>If necessary, slip one hand under the pillow, raise
the head a little, holding the glass to the lips with the
other. Anyone lying down should take food very slowly.
If solid, it should be cooked, especially well, as there is
danger of choking.</p>

<p>Tubes should be washed immediately after using. If
used continuously they should be cleaned with a tube
brush made for that purpose. Straws should be burned
or destroyed. If feeding with a spoon, be careful that
neither the food nor the spoon burns the lips or mouth.
Feed slowly and a little at a time, allowing plenty of
time between mouthfuls.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Occupying and Amusing the Sick</b></div>

<p>When people are recovering from an illness, or when
they are what we call chronic invalids, they often enjoy
and are helped by being amused or occupied. At this
time a Girl Scout may be very helpful. First of all, she
should be cheerful herself. Then she should be able to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
play two or three quiet games, such as cards, dominoes,
checkers, and be able to read aloud and to tell cheerful
and amusing stories. Children may often be kept quiet
and happy by hearing little rhymes recited. It might
be a good idea for every Girl Scout to be able to tell
three short stories and three funny stories, know three
conundrums and three short poems, play three quiet
games of cards, play checkers, play dominoes and know
three puzzles.</p>

<p>Excitement is always bad for sick people and they
become tired easily, so they should not be read to, talked
to, nor played with for too long an interval, even if
they seem to wish it themselves. The Scout must always
remember that these things are being done for the pleasure
of the sick person, and she must be very patient, to
let the games or stories be of their own choosing if they
wish it, and to avoid being noisy herself.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Daily Routine</b></div>

<p>There should be a regular daily routine. Have regular
hours for feeding, bathing, giving treatment and medicines,
giving the bedpan, etc. Be punctual.</p>

<p>Usually the first thing to do in the morning is to close
or open the window as necessary, and to give the patient
a bedpan. Have it warm. Take temperature, pulse and
respiration and record them. Bring a basin of warm
water, soap, towel, etc., to wash hands and face, and a
glass of water to brush teeth. Tidy the hair. Straighten
up the room a little. Prepare and serve patient's breakfast.
After an hour the bed bath may be taken, but a tub
bath should not be taken until two hours after breakfast.</p>

<p>Make the bed. Clean up the room. If the patient is
well enough, let her read or see visitors after this. Serve
the dinner. After dinner, open the windows, lower the
shades, and let the patient rest and sleep if possible for
at least an hour. Sick people need more rest than well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
people and should have a regular hour for rest in the
daytime. If they sleep, so much the better, as it has
been proved that patients who take a nap during the day
sleep better at night. After four o'clock give a drink of
some kind of hot or cold substance, as needed or desired&mdash;broth,
milk, lemonade. In the late afternoon sick
people are often tired and restless. Change of position,
rearrangement of the pillows or a good rub give comfort
and relieve the restlessness. Diversion of some kind,
nothing noisy or exciting, may serve the same purpose.
It may be found wise to delay the bath until this time of
day as bathing has a soothing effect.</p>

<p>Between supper and bedtime the sick person should
be kept from excitement. This is a good time for reading
aloud or allowing them to read for themselves, but
a very poor time to see visitors.</p>

<p><i>Preparations for the Night.</i> Bring in all the necessities
for washing the hands and face and brushing the
teeth and combing the hair, and help where needed.
Change the nightgown (it is better to have a gown for
the day and one for the night), brush the crumbs from
the bed, make the sheet smooth, shake up the pillows
and straighten out the bedclothes, having extra covers
handy in case of need. Fill the hot water bag, attend
to the fire, if there is one, and arrange everything in
the room just as it will be needed for the night. Give
a warm drink, and allow the patient to rinse the mouth
(or, if wished, the brushing of the teeth may be delayed
until this time). The last thing to do for the sick person
is to give a good rub, paying special attention to the bony
parts (lower end of spine, shoulder-blades, hips, knees,
ankles). Then arrange the ventilation.</p>

<p>Before settling a sick person for the night, be sure
that everything about the room is done, as any moving
about after she is prepared to sleep may tend to disturb
her and prevent her from going to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>


<h3><br />5. THE HEALTH GUARDIAN
FOR GIRL SCOUTS</h3>

<p>Has the town you live in a free swimming pool with
instructors and well arranged hours for little children,
older girls and boys and grown-ups? Can you step out
after school and have a couple of hours on a well kept
tennis court? Is there a good golf course reasonably
near, with convenient trolley service? Are there plenty
of playgrounds, so that the children are off the streets?
And, since grounds are not enough, are there friendly
young play-leaders connected with them, to get the children
together and teach them all sorts of games and
sports?</p>

<p>If none of these things are to be found, or not enough
of them, wouldn't you like to have them?</p>

<p>"Of course I should," you reply, "but what can I do
about it? I am only a girl, and I can't get all these things
by just wishing for them!"</p>

<p>But that's just what you can do.</p>

<p>All these things in a town mean that the town is
looking out for the health of its young people. Exercise
is one of the most important means of preserving health,
and most of the large cities nowadays are working hard
to see that no child shall be out of reach of a good park,
a good swimming pool and a good playground.</p>

<p>This all comes under the city government and as this
is a democratic form of government, these things are all
arranged by vote. That is, the citizens vote to use the
public money for such things and vote for the officials
who shall spend the money for them. Do you see that
if you make up your mind now about the village improvements
you want, you can vote for them later and get
them?</p>

<p>Women are naturally interested in all that happens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to children, and if all the women of a community should
get together and vote for everything that concerned the
health and happiness and good education of children,
can't you see what happy days their school-days would
be?</p>

<p>If you saw "Public Health" at the head of a chapter,
you might not think it looked very interesting; but when
you once get the idea that if your mother had had her
say on the Public Health Board you would have had a
fine skating pond with a good skate-house, last winter,
and sunny, well-aired school rooms to study in, with a
big gymnasium for basket ball in bad weather, you may
be more interested in the merit badge for Public Health
called "Health Guardian!"</p>

<p>Remember that Public Health is simply good housekeeping,
applied to the community.</p>

<p>It is a subject which women are sure to take up more
and more, and a Girl Scout who has given the matter a
little thought and study is going to make a good citizen
later on, and will be certain to have her advice asked&mdash;and
taken&mdash;in the matter of making her town healthy and
happy.</p>

<p>For instance, if the desks in the public schools are not
of the right height and shape, the children are bound to
suffer in their health and hygiene.</p>

<p>It is the business of the State to see that all public
buildings, schools, theatres, factories, etc., have a certain
amount of light and air to the cubic foot, because
so much is necessary for health.</p>

<p>It is the business of the State to see that only a certain
number of hours a day should constitute a day's work.
This is because a certain amount of rest is a necessity
for all citizens.</p>

<p>It is the business of the State to see that food and
water can be brought into the community. Also that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
be kept pure, both in transportation and after they reach
the community. This includes the policing of all reservoirs
and the filtering of the water; the refrigerating of
meat and milk; the condemning of rotten fruit and vegetables;
the collecting and disposal of all garbage and
waste.</p>

<p>It is the business of the state to prevent spitting in
public places, (one of the greatest sources of public
infection); to prevent the use of common drinking
utensils, towels, etc.; to insist on the isolation of contagious
diseases and the placarding of the houses where
they occur.</p>

<p>In order to carry on these great wise policies the state
should offer free clinics where citizens can find out what
is the matter with them and how to prevent it, and trained
community nurses for the sick.</p>

<p>Do you see what a wonderful power an intelligent
woman can be in the community she lives in? Women
ought to be much better, really, in this public housekeeping
than men, because most of them have had to
learn to do it on a small scale, and know how necessary
light, air, rest, exercise and cleanliness are.</p>

<p>But, you may say, as yet, I am too young to vote, anyway;
what can I do?</p>

<p>The answer is very simple: every citizen, whether she
is young or old, whether she has a vote or not, can find
out the laws of the town she lives in and help to enforce
them!</p>

<p>And the most important of these laws are those which
affect the public safety and the public health. Whether
there is a Public Health Commissioner or a Town Board
or a Village Superintendent or only a District Nurse to
appeal to, there is sure to be somebody whose business
it is to listen to violation of the law.</p>

<p>If every troop of Girl Scouts knew the health laws of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
their town, <i>and helped to get them obeyed</i>, there would
be a wonderful lessening of epidemics and a wonderful
advance in the health and beauty of our towns.</p>

<p>If the Girl Scouts stood, all over the country, for the
intelligent guardianship of the public health and recreation,
they would rapidly become one of the greatest and
most respected organizations in America, for this reason
alone.</p>


<h3><br />6. THE HEALTH WINNER</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>... For since a little self-control, since
a clean and elementary diet, pure water, openness
of the body to sun and air, a share of honest
work, and some degree of mental peace and largesse,
are the simple conditions of health, and are
or ought to be, accessible to everybody&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"<i>To neglect these is sheer treason.</i>"</p>

<div class='right'>
<i>&mdash;Toward Democracy, by Edward Carpenter.</i><br />
</div></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Five Points of Health for Girl Scouts</b></div>

<p>A cheerful Scout, a clean Scout, a helpful Scout, is a
well Scout. She is the only Scout that really <i>is prepared</i>.
She not only knows the laws of health, she lives
them: she stands tall, she plays daily in the open air,
she rests and sleeps at night, and conserves her energy
at all times, she is careful to get the right amount of air,
water, sun and food each day, and perhaps most important
of all, she keeps clean.</p>

<p>1. <i>Stand Tall</i>&mdash;Every Scout should be recognized a
long way off, not only by her uniform, but by her erect
carriage. In sitting, the lower back should be against
the back of the chair. In bending forward to read or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
write, bend straight from the hips. At Scout meetings
practice sitting without support for the back. When "at
ease" during drill, stand with feet apart and parallel and
with hands hanging free. When resting, lie flat on the
back without pillows. Correct posture is obtained by
balancing the different parts of the body&mdash;hips, head,
chest in a straight line, so that the bony framework bears
the weight. The muscles and ligaments will not then be
strained, and the bones will not be forced into an abnormal
position. Two rules to remember are: "Stand
tall" and "Keep your spine long."</p>

<p>2. <i>Take Exercise</i>&mdash;If you have watched soldiers obey
commands in drill you know how quickly their joints
and muscles work. The setting-up exercises given in
the Handbook have been planned to preserve the power
of joints and muscles, and to prevent them from becoming
like rusty machines. These exercises should be taken
with windows open, if not out of doors. Clothing should
be light and loose, and corsets removed. These exercises
are not to be considered a substitute for vigorous outdoor
work or play, but only as supplementary to or when
these are impossible. The day should be planned to
include at least an hour and a half of vigorous activity
in the open air. This will take different forms, according
to the place and season, so that in the summer one
may swim, row or paddle, or play tennis or any other
game outdoors, and in the winter skate, coast or snowshoe.
However, the best all year round exercise, and
the simplest and easiest to get is walking. Five miles
a day is an adequate average. Even walking alone is
good exercise, but walking in a group or two and two is
better, because keeping step, singing, whistling and talking
and laughing together add enormously to the exhilaration
of motion and of sun, wind or rain in the face.</p>

<p>A Girl Scout should avoid unusual exercise before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
during and immediately following menstruation. However,
she should remember that a reasonable amount of
exercise at this time is quite normal and beneficial, except
where there is an actual disorder of some sort.
In this case a physician should be consulted.</p>

<p>3. <i>Rest and Conserve Energy</i>&mdash;Go to bed early and
sleep from eight to eleven hours, according to age. Sleep
with windows open all the year round. Rest sometime
during the day, flat on the back if possible, but even
five minutes sitting quietly with hands in the lap and
eyes closed is better than nothing. The following table
shows the number of hours of sleep that are needed at
different ages:</p>



<div class='center'>

</table></div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Save Your Eyes</b></div>

<p>The reason it is important to rest and to sleep enough
is because it is while at rest that the body regains energy
lost during activity, and stores it up for future work and
play. There are other ways of saving energy, and one
of them is by keeping the body in such good repair that
like a good machine it does its work with a minimum
expenditure of force and heat. This is the main reason
for the setting-up exercises, or indeed for any sort of
exercises. Perhaps the single best way to save energy
is by saving your eyes. There is almost no work or play
that does not involve the use of our eyes. If people are
blind they can learn to do many things without vision,
but it is infinitely harder than with it. Modern life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
especially in cities, makes a constant demand on our eyes,
and more than this, the demand is on one part of the
eyes&mdash;the muscles concerned in near work. The best
way to rest the eyes, and one which not only rests the
tired parts but exercises the parts that are not used, is
by doing things that will involve <i>distant vision</i>. Walking
and looking far ahead and far away on every side rests
the eyes best of all, and this is one reason why a good
walk will often clear up a headache. Another way to insure
distant vision is by riding backward in a car. Then
as the landscape flows past you, your eye muscles relax
to the position needed for distant vision. If you cannot
walk or ride and are doing close work, like sewing or
reading, look up and "at nothing" every once in a while.</p>

<p>The following are some important rules to remember
in saving your eyes:</p>

<p>Rest your "near" eye muscles by looking at distant
objects and places.</p>

<p>Do not work facing a light or where the rays from a
light cross your field of vision directly.</p>

<p>Work so far as possible by indirect or reflected light.</p>

<p>If you must work near uncovered artificial lights, wear
an eye-shade.</p>

<p>When sewing or writing have the light at your left,
unless you are left-handed. This is to keep the shadow
of your hands from the work.</p>

<p>Avoid a glare or light that is in streaks or bars of
alternate dark and bright. Diffused, even light is best.</p>

<p>Have your eyes examined by a competent oculist immediately:</p>

<p>If you have headaches,</p>

<p>If the eyes sting or burn after using,</p>

<p>If print or other objects dance or blur,</p>

<p>If you must get close to your work to see it,</p>

<p>If near work tires your eyes or you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>If there is the slightest irritation or soreness about the
lids or other parts.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>How to Avoid Muscle Strain</b></div>

<p>Girls and women in attempting to live an outdoor life
or indeed when trying to do many of the things numbered
among the Scout activities, such as First Aid,
Home Nursing and Hiking, often give themselves quite
unnecessary pain and fatigue from lifting, pulling and
carrying weights in the wrong way. Ability to carry
and lift or move is not so much dependent upon absolute
strength as it is on knowing how. The whole body, so
far as it is a physical mechanism, may be thought of as
a series of levers, of which the muscles, bones, and
joints make up the parts and are fulcrum, power arm
or weight arm as the case may be. Without going into
the details of bodily structure or even knowing the names
of the different bones and muscles, it is possible to learn
a few simple things about the right use of these levers
that will be useful at all times.</p>

<p>Certain parts of the body are more able to do heavy
work than others, and the first thing to remember is that
the upper part of the back, the shoulders and the upper
arms are stronger than the lower back, the abdomen
and the lower arms. Therefore, whenever you are trying
to lift or move an object, see if you cannot use
these stronger parts. If the arms are held away from
the body when lifting, pulling, throwing or pushing, the
muscles of the upper arm, the shoulders and the upper
back will be brought into play. If the arms are held
close to the body, the lower-arm muscles are unduly
taxed and in trying to help them out, pressure is made
on the abdominal and pelvic muscles, which are not
fitted to bear this sort of strain. Therefore, in carrying
a bag or suitcase, where this is absolutely unavoidable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
try to swing the arm free from the body, so as to use
the upper arm and back muscles for the weight.</p>

<p>Another important way to save strain is by pushing
instead of pulling. It is almost impossible to push anything
so hard as to injure your back or abdominal muscles.
It is almost impossible, on the other hand, to pull
even a relatively light weight without some strain. If
you will think of how a horse in harness actually exerts
his strength in drawing a wagon, you will see that what
he does is to <i>push</i> against the straps, and it is the straps
that <i>pull</i> the wagon. Even the strongest horse could
not pull a wagon with his teeth very far, or pull something
tied only to the back leg muscles. <i>Get behind and
push</i> is the rule to remember, and never resort to <i>pulling</i>
until you have tried every device for pushing instead.</p>

<p>If you <i>must</i> pull, try to use heavy muscles, such as <i>leg</i>
muscles, to do it with. Often a weight may be lifted or
pulled by getting the foot under or in back and using
the arms only to steer with. This applies particularly to
objects like trunks or bureaus.</p>

<p>Always take advantage of any natural leverage that
you can and if you must move something heavy, do not
lift it at once and attempt to carry it, but lift one end
and swing or shove it and then lift the other end and
shove it. If you will watch expressmen at work you will
notice that they roll boxes and trunks, holding them
almost on end and tipping them just enough to turn
them along their shortest axis. In this way the boxes
carry themselves, so far as their main weight is concerned.</p>

<p>Carrying a weight on the head or shoulders is another
way of converting a pull into a push, and this is taken
advantage of by peasant women in Europe, who often
are seen carrying heavy weights to market in baskets
perched on their heads, while they stride along arm-free.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
A knapsack strapped on to the shoulders is not only
more convenient because it leaves the arms and hands
free to swing naturally or use for other purposes, but
because the weight is distributed and is carried by means
of heavy muscles pushing up under the strap. A weight
should be distributed over a set of muscles as evenly as
possible, and this is the reason for suspending a knapsack
from two shoulders instead of one, when possible.</p>

<p>Finally, in doing any sort of lifting or pulling, if the
muscles that are to be used are contracted before grasping
the weight they will be able to do their work with
far less effort. Try lifting a small weight like a book in
two ways&mdash;first, have your hand and fingers relaxed
and limp when you grasp it, and see how heavy it seems
and how hard it is to contract your muscles properly
while lifting it. Then drop the book and go at it again,
this time anticipating its weight and contracting your
hand and finger muscles before grasping it. See how
easily it comes up. Try this same thing with heavier
weights, and learn <i>always to contract the muscle before
taking the load</i>. In carrying a weight for any distance
it is well to shift it from one arm to another, always
preparing the muscles by contracting them before the
weight is assumed.</p>

<p>Using the muscles so as to take advantage of their
lever-like qualities in the best way, contracting them before
loading, and pushing instead of pulling, go to make
up what is sometimes called "getting a purchase."</p>

<p>4. <i>Supply Daily Need for Air, Sun, Water and Food</i>&mdash;Besides
exercise and rest there are other controllable
factors upon which health depends. These are air, heat
and light of the sun, water and food. To grow and work
properly the body needs plenty of each of these.</p>

<p><i>Air</i>&mdash;If you cannot work or play outdoors you can
still bring out of doors in by opening your windows at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
frequent intervals. You will find that work goes better,
and that you do not tire so easily if you make it a rule
to open the windows and doors and move about the room
for five minutes every hour or two. Sleep with windows
open or out-of-doors. Camp and hike as often as
possible. Work in the garden. Play out-of-door games.</p>

<p><i>Heat</i>&mdash;The proper temperature of the body is between
98 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit. Human life depends upon
the maintenance of this temperature at all times, and very
slight changes either up or down interfere seriously with
all the other life processes. The main source of heat is
from food consumed, or really burned, in the body.
Artificial heating in houses helps conserve the body heat,
as does clothing. But clothes and shelter may make you
overheated, which is nearly as bad as being cold; they
may also shut out fresh air. Clothes should not be too
heavy nor too tight. Shoes should have soles straight
on the inner side, and be broad enough to allow the toes
full play, and have low heels. Shoes that are comfortable
to hike in are apt to be the best for all the time wear.</p>

<p>At night the clothes worn during the day should be
aired and dried thoroughly. This will help much in maintaining
the right body temperature, because clothes become
damp from wearing, and dampness uses up body
heat.</p>

<p><i>Sunlight</i>&mdash;Sunlight is one of the best health bringers
known. Little children&mdash;and grown people, too&mdash;suffering
from the most serious forms of tuberculosis, that of
the bones, get well if they are kept in the sunlight. In
one of the finest hospitals for children in the world, in
Switzerland, the main treatment is to have the children
play outdoors without clothes in the sunlight, and they
do this even when there is heavy winter snow on the
ground. Human beings droop and die without the sun,
just as plants do, though it takes longer to kill them. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
is a gloomy person who does not feel happier in the sun,
and a happy and cheerful person is generally healthy.
So get into the sun whenever you can. Walk on the
sunny side of the street, and open your windows to the
sun whenever you can. However, in hot climates and
in the warmest summer days, remember that the sun can
injure as well as help, and do not expose the head or
body unnecessarily.</p>

<p><i>Water</i>&mdash;As about three-quarters of our body weight is
water, the solid portions of bone, muscle, and so forth,
constituting only one-quarter, and as considerable water
is given off each day by evaporation from skin and lungs
and with excreta, the loss must be made up. In addition
to the water taken with meals and contained in the food
a Girl Scout should drink at least six tumblers of
water daily. This is a quart and a half. One glass
should be taken on arising and before breakfast, two
between breakfast and lunch, two between lunch and
dinner, and one before going to bed. Be sure the water
is pure, and boil any water the purity of which is doubted
in the slightest. Water kept cool in the ice chest, or in
a jar with a moist cover, is better than ice water, both
because cool water actually quenches thirst more easily,
being more readily absorbed than ice cold water, and
because it is difficult to control the purity of ice.</p>

<p><i>Food</i>&mdash;Food should be clean and kept clean. Growing
girls can tell whether they are eating enough of the
right sort of food, and if they are getting the best out
of it, by seeing whether they are up to the right weight
for their height and age. A chart is given at the end of
this section showing the standard weight for each height
at each age. The following are good rules to follow in
making your daily food habits:</p>

<p>Do not eat between meals.</p>

<p>Eat slowly and chew food thoroughly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Eat freely of coarse cereals and breads.</p>

<p>Eat meat only once a day.</p>

<p>Have green vegetables, salad or fruit every day.</p>

<p>Drink as much milk as possible, but no coffee or tea.</p>

<p>If you do not have at least one bowel movement a
day it is a sign of constipation, which means the accumulation
of waste material from food in the intestine. Exercise,
especially walking, eating coarse vegetables,
coarse breads and coarse cereals, and fruit, and drinking
enough water will help the bowels to move properly.
Constipation is not only an unclean habit of the body,
but it is dangerous, because the waste matter decays
and poison is carried all over the body. Headaches,
indigestion, bad breath and chronic fatigue are some of
the results.</p>

<p>5. <i>Keep Clean</i>&mdash;A Girl Scout should be sure that
the air, water and food that she allows to enter her body
are clean. Be sure that they are pure when they reach
her, and keep them so by keeping her body, clothes and
room clean with the help of sun, soap and water. You
have probably heard of germs, microbes and bacteria.
These are names for the same organisms, which are
tiny forms of plant life unseen by the eye, and of which
our unaided senses give us no knowledge. They exist
everywhere and in many forms. Most of them are
harmless to human life, and many of them are useful,
as, for example, one that grows on the roots of peas
and beans and helps the plants to extract nitrogen from
the air. Some bacteria, however, are harmful, and these
are known as disease germs, as they are active in producing
diseases, especially those diseases which we know
as contagious. The dangerous germs nearly all live in
dust and dirt and in dark places. When we clean house
and dispose of waste material and bring air and sunlight
into dark and dirty places we are doing more than removing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
unpleasant sights and smells, we are destroying
the breeding places of disease.</p>

<p>Every girl wants a clear skin. Proper food, water
and exercise give this; but it is also necessary to keep
the surface clean by taking a hot bath with soap at least
twice a week, and a cold or tepid sponge and rubdown
the other days. Besides the loose dirt which comes on
the body from the outside, perspiration and oil come
from the inside through the skin pores, and when accumulated
give a disagreeable odor. Special attention is
needed to guard against this odor, particularly under the
armpits, and soap and water should be used daily. A
hot bath is relaxing and opens the pores. A cold bath
is stimulating and closes the pores. A hot bath is best
taken at night, or if taken in the morning, follow by a
cool sponge or shower. Do not take a cold plunge bath
unless advised to do so by a physician.</p>

<p>Always wash the hands immediately before handling
or preparing food and before eating. Always wash
hands after going to the bathroom. Keep nails short,
and clean with nail brush each time the hands are washed
and with orange stick when necessary.</p>

<p>During menstruation it is particularly important to
keep the body and clothes scrupulously clean, by bathing
or washing with plenty of water.</p>

<p><i>Hair</i>&mdash;Air and a good brushing every day will keep
the hair in good condition. It should be washed once
in two weeks. Wash with hot soapsuds and rinse thoroughly,
using first hot, then cooler, and finally cold
water. Keep the hair brush clean by washing in cold
water and soap and a little ammonia at least once a
week. The brush should be dried in the sun, not by
artificial heat.</p>

<p><i>Ears</i>&mdash;Keep the outer surfaces of the ears clean, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
leave the inner part alone. Do not poke for wax or
put oil in the ear.</p>

<p><i>Feet</i>&mdash;Bathe the feet in hot water at night, when tired.
In the morning bathe with cold water after hot, to harden
them for walking. Keep the toenails clean, and cut evenly.</p>

<p><i>Teeth</i>&mdash;Next to a fresh, sweet skin the most beautiful
feature of a truly beautiful woman is her teeth. The
basis of beautiful teeth is a clean mouth. Teeth should
be brushed at least twice a day. The best times are after
breakfast and the last thing before going to bed. A brush
with medium soft bristles should be used. Clean a new
brush thoroughly with soap and water and soak in cold
water to set the bristles. A toothbrush should be cleansed
and aired and if possible sunned every day. Never use
a brush that has begun to lose its bristles, or which has
become caked or yellow. Paste or powder that is not
gritty should be used. Always brush away from the
gums; that is, brush the upper teeth down, and the lower
teeth up. Clean the roof of the mouth and the tongue.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to have the teeth examined at least
every six months. Then any repairs or cleaning that
may be needed can be easily attended to and much future
pain, trouble and expense saved.</p>

<p><i>Eyes</i>&mdash;Wash eyes carefully for "sleepers" in the morning.
Bathing with alternate hot and cold will rest and
strengthen the muscles.</p>

<p><i>General Safeguards</i>&mdash;Do not use public towels or
drinking cups.</p>

<p>Do not use towels, handkerchiefs or other toilet articles
or glasses or cups or table utensils used by others.</p>

<p>Avoid sneezing or coughing into another person's
face.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Measurements</b></div>

<p>Every Girl Scout should know her measurements, including
her height, her weight, her waist measure, her
chest girth and her chest expansion. Not only are these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
things convenient to know when ordering uniforms and
buying clothes, but any physical director, gymnasium
teacher or doctor can tell her if these are in good proportion
for her age and general development and advise her
as to how she may go about to improve them if they
need it.</p>

<p>The accompanying table (given in the last section of
the Health Record) shows the right height and weight
for girls at different ages. The way to consult it is as
follows:</p>

<p>First, find your height by measuring yourself without
shoes against a wall. The best way to do is to have
someone lay a ruler on top of your head so that it extends
to the wall and touches it at right angles. Then
the place should be marked and the distance measured
with a yard stick or tape. Count a half inch as the next
highest inch; thus if you measure 59-1/2 inches call this
60. If you measure 59-1/4 count it as an even 59. Stand
with heels against the wall, and head high: "Stand
Tall."</p>

<p>Second, find your weight with only indoor clothes on.
Take the weight to the nearest pound, counting as before
a half pound or three-quarters as the next highest
and disregard the amounts less than one-half.</p>

<p>Then take your card and look along the top row for
the age to which you are nearest, counting six months
past one year mark as the next year. Thus, if you are
within six months of being 13, count yourself 13.</p>

<p>Then look at the left-hand upright row of figures and
find your height in inches.</p>

<p>Then with a rule or paper find the corresponding number
of pounds for your height and age.</p>

<p>You will see that a girl may be any number of inches
tall within wide limits, but her weight must correspond
to her height rather than simply to her age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>A girl should be within ten per cent of the proper
weight for her age and height. If you find that you
are underweight, do not be frightened or discouraged,
as it is quite easy to get up to normal by following the
health rules, particularly those relating to food, water
and sleep. Drink as much milk as possible, and eat fresh
vegetables and don't spoil your appetite by eating too
many sweets or nibbling between meals. If you find
that after a month you are still more than ten per cent
underweight, then ask your parents if you can see the
doctor or consult the school physician.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>A Health Record Chart for Girl Scouts</b></div>

<p>Girl Scouts who are working for "The Health
Winner" badge should keep an account of their progress
for three months, and a good way to do it is to have a
Health Chart to fill out daily and bring the record for
each week to their Captain, at troop meeting. The chart
given below is suggested as a model, and copies will be
obtainable from National Headquarters, but troops can
make up their own.</p>

<p>Every Scout is naturally a Health Crusader, and she
can use the blanks provided by the National Modern
Health Crusade if she so desires.</p>

<p>In this case the first two points can be combined,
which relate to washing hands and face, and an additional
point inserted in place of the second, to the
effect that "I ate no sweets, candy, cake or ice cream
between meals today."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h2>SECTION XII</h2>

<h3>SETTING-UP EXERCISES FOR GIRL SCOUTS</h3>

<p>Our bodies are like machines that need frequent oiling
and testing to see that all parts are working right.</p>

<p>Or they are like instruments that must be tuned before
they are played.</p>

<p>If this is not done, the machinery gets rusty and
clogged, or the instrument gets out of tune and makes
horrid noises.</p>

<p>That is the way it is with our bodies; our muscles and
joints should be bent and stretched every day to take the
kinks out, and keep them strong and flexible.</p>

<p>The best way is to tune up every morning for just a
few minutes before you put on your clothes, and then
again at night to rest the tired parts and exercise the
parts that have not been used, so you can even things
up.</p>


<div class='center'><b>The Right Position</b></div>

<p>First of all try to stand in the right position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/footprinta.png" width="300" height="48" alt="Proper walking patter" title="" />
</div>

<p>Stand with the feet side by side, a few inches apart
and pointed straight ahead. Many people think you
should turn out your toes because they think it looks
better. This is not natural. If you stand on a step
with one foot even with the edge, and let the other foot
hang over the step below, it will hang parallel with the
foot you are standing on. That is the way it is meant
to go, and people who turn out their toes do so much
walking sideways that they have to travel much farther
than if they kept their feet pointed in the direction they
want to go.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/footprintb.png" width="300" height="54" alt="Improper walking pattern" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Then your legs should come up straight from your
ankles; don't stand either on your heels or your toes, but
right over the highest part of the arch, which is the
strongest part, and best fitted to bear your weight when
you are standing still, and brings your hips up to just
the right place to hold your body.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the lower part of your body are some big heavy
bones shaped somewhat like a bowl. This bowl is balanced
on the top of your legs, and holds most of your
organs. If this bowl is balanced just right, the organs
remain in place, the way they are meant to be, but if it
is not balanced right, the contents are tipped so that they
would come tumbling out if the muscles intended for other
work did not hold them in. This is hard on these muscles
which have their own work to do, and if they are used
to hold up things that should keep their own balance,
sooner or later they give way, and there is a sad accident,
or a general slump. Then instead of saying, "That foolish
person always stood in the wrong position and of course
her insides got out of place," we say, "Poor dear so-and-so
has given out from overwork and has acute indigestion,
or a 'floating kidney,' or 'a bad liver.' How could it
have happened?"</p>

<p>If your underpinning is all right it is not difficult to be
straight above.</p>

<p>Let your shoulders hang easily in a straight line under
your ears, in the position they will naturally take if from
side stretch (fig. 3) the arms drop easily to the side.
<i>Don't arch your chest and throw your shoulders back!</i>
This is not a slump and does not mean to let your back
bow out. If your shoulders are easy you can straighten
your back and your head will balance itself, and there
you are: a straight upstanding Scout, ready for what
comes next.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>Remember: a) Feet pointing straight ahead.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">b) Body balanced on legs coming up
straight from ankles.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">c) Shoulders easy under ears.</span></p></div>

<p>This gives a straight line from top of head through
shoulders and hips to between ankles.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>General Rules</b></div>

<p>Stretch to the very tips of your middle fingers&mdash;stretching
makes your muscles flexible.</p>

<p>Breathe in as arms rise and out as they fall.</p>

<p>Stand tall.</p>

<p>Sit tall.</p>

<p>Remember the straight line that comes from the top
of your head down to between your ankles.</p>

<p>Keep limber, don't let your knees grow stiff.</p>

<p>Sit crosslegged on the floor. Sit on your heels.</p>

<p>Rise without help from your hands.</p>


<div class='center'><b>The Exercises</b></div>

<p>Now tune up: begin by repeating each exercise four
times; then increase to 8, 12, or 16; never more than 16.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>TWELVE SECRETS OF THE WOODS</b></div>

<p>Do you know the twelve secrets of the woods?</p>

<p>Do you know the umbrella that stands up spread to
show that there is a restaurant in the cellar?</p>

<p>Do you know the "manna-food" that grows on the
rocks, summer and winter, and holds up its hands in the

how good it is?</p>

<p>Do you know the vine that climbs above the sedge to
whisper on the wind "There are cocoanuts in my basement"?</p>

<p>Can you tell why the rabbit puts his hind feet down
ahead of his front ones as he runs?</p>

<p>Can you tell why the squirrel buries every other nut
and who it was that planted those shag-barks along the
fence?</p>

<p>Can you tell what the woodchuck does in midwinter
and on what day?</p>

<p>Have you learned to know the pale villain of the
open woods&mdash;the deadly amanita, for whose fearful
poison no remedy is known?</p>

<p>Have you learned to overcome the poison ivy that was
once so feared&mdash;now so lightly held by those who know?</p>

<p>Have you proved the balsam fir in all its fourfold gifts&mdash;as
Christmas tree, as healing balm, as consecrated bed,

Church?</p>

<p>Can you tell what walked around your tent on the

<p>Then are you wise. You have learned the twelve
secrets of the woods. But if you have not, come and
let us teach you.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WEATHER WISDOM</b></div>

<div class='poem'>
When the dew is on the grass,<br />
Rain will never come to pass.<br />
When the grass is dry at night,<br />
Look for rain before the light.<br />
When grass is dry at morning light,<br />
Look for rain before the night.<br />
Three days' rain will empty any sky.<br />
A deep, clear sky of fleckless blue<br />
Breeds storms within a day or two.<br />
When the wind is in the east,<br />
It's good for neither man nor beast.<br />
When the wind is in the north,<br />
The old folk should not venture forth.<br />
When the wind is in the south,<br />
It blows the bait in the fishes' mouth.<br />
When the wind is in the west,<br />
It is of all the winds the best.<br />
An opening and a shetting<br />
Is a sure sign of a wetting.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Another version)</span><br />
Open and shet,<br />
Sure sign of wet.<br />
<span style="margin-left: -2em;">(Still another)</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>It's lighting up to see to rain.<br />
Evening red and morning gray<br />
Sends the traveler on his way.<br />
Evening gray and morning red<br />
Sends the traveler home to bed.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem2'><br />
Red sky at morning, the shepherd takes warning;<br />
Red sky at night is the shepherd's delight.<br />
</div>

<p>If the sun goes down cloudy Friday, sure of a clear
Sunday.</p>

<p>If a rooster crows standing on a fence or high place,
it will clear. If on the ground, it doesn't count.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Between eleven and two<br />
You can tell what the weather is going to do.<br />
Rain before seven, clear before eleven.<br />
</div>

<p>Fog in the morning, bright sunny day.</p>

<p>If it rains, and the sun is shining at the same time,
the devil is whipping his wife and it will surely rain
tomorrow.</p>

<p>If it clears off during the night, it will rain again
shortly.</p>

<p>Sun drawing water, sure sign of rain.</p>

<p>A circle round the moon means "storm." As many
stars as are in circle, so many days before it will rain.</p>

<p>Sudden heat brings thunder.</p>

<p>A storm that comes against the wind is always a
thunderstorm.</p>

<p>East wind brings rain.</p>

<p>West wind brings clear, bright, cool weather.</p>

<p>North wind brings cold.</p>

<p>South wind brings heat. (On Atlantic coast.)</p>

<p>The rain-crow or cuckoo (both species) is supposed by
all hunters to foretell rain, when its "Kow, kow, kow" is
long and hard.</p>

<p>So, also, the tree-frog cries before rain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Swallows flying low is a sign of rain; high, of clearing
weather.</p>

<p>The rain follows the wind, and the heavy blast is just
before the shower.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OUTDOOR PROVERBS</b></div>

<p>What weighs an ounce in the morning, weighs a pound
at night.</p>

<p>A pint is a pound the whole world round.</p>

<p>Allah reckons not against a man's allotted time the
days he spends in the chase.</p>

<p>If there's only one, it isn't a track, it's an accident.</p>

<p>Better safe than sorry.</p>

<p>No smoke without fire.</p>

<p>The bluejay doesn't scream without reason.</p>

<p>The worm don't see nuffin pretty 'bout de robin's song.&mdash;(Darkey.)</p>

<p>Ducks flying over head in the woods are generally
pointed for water.</p>

<p>If the turtles on a log are dry, they have been there
half an hour or more, which means no one has been near
to alarm them.</p>

<p>Cobwebs across a hole mean "nothing inside."</p>

<p>Whenever you are trying to be smart, you are going
wrong. Smart Aleck always comes to grief.</p>

<p>You are safe and winning, when you are trying to be
kind.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>WHEN LOST IN THE WOODS</b></div>

<p>If you should miss your way, the first thing to remember
is like the Indian, "You are not lost; it is the teepee
that is lost." It isn't serious. It cannot be so, unless
you do something foolish.</p>

<p>The first and most natural thing to do is to get on a
hill, up a tree, or other high lookout, and seek for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
landmark near the camp. You may be sure of these
things:</p>

<p>You are not nearly as far from camp as you think you
are.</p>

<p>Your friends will soon find you.</p>

<p>You can help them best by signalling.</p>

<p>The worst thing you can do is to get frightened. The
truly dangerous enemy is not the cold or the hunger, so
much as the fear. It is fear that robs the wanderer of
his judgment and of his limb power; it is fear that turns
the passing experience into a final tragedy. Only keep
cool and all will be well.</p>

<p>If there is snow on the ground, you can follow your
back track.</p>

<p>If you see no landmark, look for the smoke of the fire.
Shout from time to time, and wait; for though you have
been away for hours it is quite possible you are within
earshot of your friends. If you happen to have a gun,
fire it off twice in quick succession on your high lookout,
then wait and listen. Do this several times and wait
plenty long enough, perhaps an hour. If this brings no
help, send up a distress signal&mdash;that is, make two smoke
fires by smothering two bright fires with green leaves and
rotten wood, and keep them at least fifty feet apart, or
the wind will confuse them. Two shots or two smokes
are usually understood to mean "I am in trouble." Those
in camp on seeing this should send up one smoke, which
means "Camp is here."</p>

<p>In a word, "keep cool, make yourself comfortable,
leave a record of your travels, and help your friends to
find you."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>EDIBLE WILD PLANTS</b></div>

<p>No one truly knows the woods until he can find with
certainty a number of wild plants that furnish good food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
for man in the season when food is scarce; that is, in the
winter or early spring.</p>

<p>During summer and autumn there is always an abundance
of familiar nuts and berries, so that we may rule
them out, and seek only for edible plants and roots that
are available when nuts and berries are not.</p>

<p><i>Rock Tripe.</i> The most wonderful of all is probably
the greenish-black rock tripe, found on the bleakest, highest
rocks in the northern parts of this continent. There
is a wonderful display of it on the cliffs about Mohonk
Lake, in the Catskills. Richardson and Franklin, the
great northern explorers, lived on it for months. It must
be very carefully cooked or it produces cramps. First
gather and wash it as clear as possible of sand and grit,
washing it again and again, snipping off the gritty parts
of the roots where it held onto the mother rock. Then
roast it slowly in a pan till dry and crisp. Next boil
it for one hour and serve it either hot or cold. It looks
like thick gumbo soup with short, thick pieces of black
and green leaves in it. It tastes a little like tapioca with
a slight flavoring of licorice. On some it acts as a purge.</p>

<p><i>Basswood Browse or Buds.</i> As a child I ate these raw
in quantities, as did also most of my young friends, but
they will be found the better for cooking. They are
particularly good and large in the early spring. The
inmost bark also has food value, but one must disfigure
the tree to get that, so we leave it out.</p>

<p><i>Slippery Elm.</i> The same remarks apply to the buds
and inner bark of the slippery elm. They are nutritious,
acceptable food, especially when cooked with scraps of
meat or fruit for flavoring. Furthermore, its flowers
come out in the spring before the leaves, and produce
very early in the season great quantities of seed which
are like little nuts in the middle of a nearly circular wing.
These ripen by the time the leaves are half grown and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
have always been an important article of food among the
wild things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">
<a href="images/i040-big.png"><img src="images/i040.png" width="352" height="500" alt="Wild Food&mdash;Plants" title="" /></a>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Many Indian tribes used to feed during famine times
on the inner bark of cedar and white birch, as well as on
the inner bark of the slippery elm and basswood, but these
cannot be got without injury to the tree, so omit them.</p>

<p>When the snow is off the ground the plants respond
quickly, and it is safe to assume that all the earliest
flowers come up from big, fat roots.</p>

<p>A plant can spring up quickly in summer, gathering the
material of growth from the air and soil, but a plant
coming up in the early spring is doing business at a time
when it cannot get support from its surroundings, and
cannot keep on unless it has stored up capital from the
summer before. This is the logic of the storehouse in
the ground for these early comers.</p>

<p><i>Wapato.</i> One of the earliest is wapato, or duck potato,
also called common Arrowleaf, or Sagittaria. It is found
in low, swampy flats, especially those that are under water
for part of the year. Its root is about as big as a walnut
and is good food, cooked, or raw. These roots are not
at the point where the leaves come out but at the ends
of the long roots.</p>

<p><i>Bog Potato.</i> On the drier banks, usually where the
sedge begins near a swamp, we find the bog potato, or
Indian potato. The plant is a slender vine with three,
five, or seven leaflets in a group. On its roots in spring
are from one to a dozen potatoes, varying from an inch
to three inches in diameter. They taste like a cross between
a peanut and a raw potato, and are very good
cooked or raw.</p>

<p><i>Indian Cucumber.</i> In the dry woods one is sure to
see the pretty umbrella of the Indian cucumber. Its root
is white and crisp and tastes somewhat like a cucumber,
is one to four inches long, and good food raw or boiled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Calopogon.</i> This plant looks like a kind of grass with
an onion for a root, but it does not taste of onions and is
much sought after by wild animals and wild people. It
is found in low or marshy places.</p>

<p><i>Hog Peanuts.</i> In the early spring this plant will be
found to have a large nut or fruit, buried under the leaves
or quite underground in the dry woods. As summer
goes by the plant uses up this capital, but on its roots it
grows a lot of little nuts. These are rich food, but very
small. The big nut is about an inch long and the little
ones on the roots are any size up to that of a pea.</p>

<p><i>Indian Turnip or Jack-in-the-Pulpit.</i> This is well
known to all our children in the East. The root is the
most burning, acrid, horrible thing in the woods when
raw, but after cooking becomes quite pleasant and is
very nutritious.</p>

<p><i>Prairie or Indian Turnip, Bread-root or Pomme-blanche
of the Prairie.</i> This is found on all the prairies
of the Missouri region. Its root was and is a staple article
of food with the Indians. The roots are one to three
inches thick and four to twelve inches long.</p>

<p><i>Solomon's Seal.</i> The two Solomon's Seals (true and
false) both produce roots that are long, bumpy storehouses
of food.</p>

<p><i>Crinkle-root.</i> Every school child in the country digs
out and eats the pleasant peppery crinkle-root. It abounds
in the rich dry woods.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>MUSHROOMS, FUNGI OR TOADSTOOLS</b></div>

<p>We have in America about two thousand different kinds
of Mushrooms or Toadstools; they are the same thing.
Of these, probably half are wholesome and delicious;
but about a dozen of them are deadly poison.</p>

<p>There is no way to tell them, except by knowing each
kind and the recorded results of experience with each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
kind. The story about cooking with silver being a test
has no foundation; in fact, the best way for the Woodcraft
Boy or Girl is to know definitely a dozen dangerous
kinds and a score or more of the wholesome kinds and
let the rest alone.</p>

<p><i>Sporeprint.</i> The first thing in deciding the nature of a
toadstool is the sporeprint, made thus: Cut off the stem
of the toadstool and lay the gills down on a piece of gray
paper under a vessel of any kind. After a couple of
hours, lift the cap, and radiating lines of spores will
appear on the paper. If it is desired to preserve these,
the paper should be first covered with thin mucilage. The
<i>color</i> of these spores is the first step in identification.</p>

<p>All the deadly toadstools have <i>white</i> spores.</p>

<p>No black-spored toadstool is known to be poisonous.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>POISONOUS TOADSTOOLS</b></div>

<p>The only deadly poisonous kinds are the Amanitas.
Others may purge and nauseate or cause vomiting, but it
is believed that every recorded death from toadstool
poisoning was caused by an Amanita, and unfortunately
they are not only widespread and abundant, but they are
much like the ordinary table mushrooms. They have,
however, one or two strong marks: their stalk always
grows out of a "<i>poison cup</i>" which shows either as a
cup or as a <i>bulb</i>; they have <i>white</i> or <i>yellow</i> gills, a ring
around the stalk, and <i>white spores</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Deadly Toadstools</b></div>

<p>All the deadly toadstools known in North America are
pictured on the plate, or of the types shown on the plate.</p>

<p>The Deadly Amanita may be brownish, yellowish, or
white.</p>

<p>The Yellow Amanita of a delicate lemon color.</p>

<p>The White Amanita of a pure silvery, shiny white.</p>

<p>The Fly Amanita with cap pink, brown, yellow, or red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in the centre, shaded into yellow at the edge, and patched
with fragments of pure white veil.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 426px;">
<a href="images/i041-big.png"><img src="images/i041.png" width="426" height="500" alt="Aramintas" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Frosty Amanita with yellow cap, pale cadmium
in centre, elsewhere yellowish white, with white patches
on warts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>All are very variable in color, etc.</p>

<p>But all agree in these things. They have <i>gills</i>, which
are <i>white</i> or <i>yellow</i>, <i>a ring on the stalk</i>, <i>a cup at the base</i>,
<i>white spores</i>, and are <i>deadly poison</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>In Case of Poisoning</b></div>

<p>If by ill chance any one has eaten a poisonous Amanita,
the effects do not begin to show till sixteen or eighteen
hours afterward&mdash;that is, long after the poison has passed
through the stomach and began its deadly work on the
nerve centres.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms</i>. Vomiting and purging, "the discharge
from the bowels being watery with small flakes suspended,
and sometimes containing blood," cramps in the extremities.
The pulse is very slow and strong at first,
but later weak and rapid, sometimes sweat and saliva
pour out. Dizziness, faintness, and blindness, the skin
clammy, cold, and bluish or livid; temperature low with
dreadful tetanic convulsions, and finally stupor. (McIlvaine
and Macadam, p. 627.)</p>

<p><i>Remedy</i>: "Take an emetic at once, and send for a physician
with instructions to bring hypodermic syringe and
atropine sulphate. The dose is 1/180 of a grain, and
doses should be continued heroically until 1/20 of a grain
is administered, or until, in the physician's opinion, a
proper quantity has been injected. Where the victim is
critically ill the 1/20 of a grain may be administered."
(McIlvaine and Macadam XVII.)</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Wholesome Toadstools</b></div>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that all the queer freaks, like
clubs and corals, the cranks and tomfools, in droll shapes
and satanic colors, the funny poisonous looking Morels,
Inkcaps, and Boleti are good wholesome food, but the
deadly Amanitas are like ordinary Mushrooms, except
that they have grown a little thin, delicate, and an&aelig;mic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 355px;">
<a href="images/i042-big.png"><img src="images/i042.png" width="355" height="439" alt="Toadstools" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>All the Puffballs are good before they begin to puff,
that is as long as their flesh is white and firm.</p>

<p>All the <i>colored</i> coral toadstools are good, but the <i>White
Clavaria</i> is said to be rather sickening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>All of the Morels are safe and delicious.</p>

<p>So also is Inky Coprinus, usually found on manure
piles. The Beefsteak Mushroom grows on stumps&mdash;chiefly
chestnut. It looks like raw meat and bleeds when
cut. It is quite good eating.</p>

<p>So far as known no black-spored toadstool is unwholesome.</p>

<p>The common Mushroom is distinguished by its general
shape, its pink or brown gills, its white flesh, brown
spores, and solid stem.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>SNAKES GOOD AND BAD</b></div>

<p>Snakes are to the animal world what toadstools are to
the vegetable world&mdash;wonderful things, beautiful things,
but fearsome things, because some of them are deadly
poison.</p>

<p>Taking Mr. Raymond L. Ditmars<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as our authority,
we learn that out of one hundred and eleven species of
snakes found in the United States, seventeen are poisonous.
They are found in every State, but are most
abundant in the Southwest.</p>

<p>These may be divided into Coral Snakes, Moccasins,
and Rattlers.</p>

<p>The coral snakes are found in the Southern States.
They are very much like harmless snakes in shape, but
are easily distinguished by their remarkable colors,
"broad alternating rings of red and black, the latter bordered
with very narrow rings of yellow."</p>

<p>The Rattlesnakes are readily told at once by the rattle.</p>

<p>But the Moccasins are not so easy. There are two
kinds: the Water Moccasin, or Cotton-mouth, found in
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana,
and the Copperhead, which is the Highland, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Northern Moccasin or Pilot Snake, found from Massachusetts
to Florida and west to Illinois and Texas.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i043.png" width="500" height="332" alt="Types of Poisonous Snakes" title="" />
<span class="caption">Types of Poisonous Snakes</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Here are distinguishing marks: The Moccasins, as well
as the Rattlers, have on each side of the head, between
the eye and nostril, a deep pit.</p>

<p>The pupil of the eye is an upright line, as in a cat; the
harmless snakes have a round pupil.</p>

<p>The Moccasins have a single row of plates under the
tail, while the harmless snakes have a double row.</p>

<p>The Water Moccasin is dull olive with wide black
transverse bands.</p>

<p>The Copperhead is dull hazel brown, marked across
the back with dumb-bells of reddish brown; the top of
the head more or less coppery.</p>

<p>Both Moccasins and Rattlers have a flat triangular
head, which is much wider than the thin neck; while
most harmless snakes have a narrow head that shades off
into the neck.</p>

<p>Rattlesnakes are found generally distributed over the
United States, southern Ontario, southern Alberta, and
Saskatchewan.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>How Does a Snake Bite</b></div>

<p>Remember, the tongue is a feeler, not a sting. The
"stinging" is done by two long hollow teeth, or fangs,
through which the poison is squirted into the wound.</p>

<p>The striking distance of a snake is about one-third the
creature's length, and the stroke is so swift that no creature
can dodge it.</p>

<p>The snake can strike farthest and surest when it is
ready coiled, but can strike a little way when traveling.</p>

<p>You cannot disarm a poisonous snake without killing
it. If the fangs are removed others come quickly to take
their place. In fact, a number of small, half-grown fangs
are always waiting ready to be developed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>In Case of Snake Bite</b></div>

<p>First, keep cool, and remember that the bite of American
snakes is seldom fatal if the proper measures are
followed.</p>

<p>You must act at once. Try to keep the poison from
getting into the system by a tight bandage on the arm
or leg (it is sure to be one or the other) just above the
wound. Next, get it out of the wound by slashing the
wound two or more ways with a sharp knife or razor
at least as deep as the puncture. Squeeze it&mdash;wash it
out with permanganate of potash dissolved in water to
the color of wine. Suck it out with the lips (if you have
no wounds in the mouth it will do you no harm there).
Work, massage, suck, and wash to get all the poison out.
After thorough treatment to remove the venom the ligature
may be removed.</p>

<p>"Pack small bits of gauze into the wounds to keep
them open and draining, then dress over them with
gauze saturated with any good antiseptic solution. Keep
the dressing saturated and the wounds open for at least
a week, no matter how favorable may be the symptoms."</p>

<p>Some people consider whiskey or brandy a cure for
snake bite. There is plenty of evidence that many have
been killed by such remedies, and little that they have
ever saved any one, except perhaps when the victim was
losing courage or becoming sleepy.</p>

<p>In any case, send as fast as you can for a doctor. He
should come equipped with hypodermic syringe, tubes of
anti-venomous serum and strychnine tablets.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Harmless Snakes</b></div>

<p>Far the greatest number of our snakes are harmless,
beautiful, and beneficient. They are friendly to the farmer,
because, although some destroy a few birds, chickens,
ducklings, and game, the largest part of their food is
mice and insects. The Blacksnake, the Milk Snake, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
one or two others, will bite in self-defence, but they have
no poison fangs, and the bite is much like the prick of
a bramble.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>THE STARS AS THE CAMPER SEES THEM</b><br />

<a href="#stars">(See Plate of Stars and Principal Constellations</a>)</div>

<p>So far as there is a central point in our heavens, that
point is the pole-star, Polaris. Around this star all the
stars in the sky seem to turn once in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It is easily discovered by the help of the Big Dipper,
<i>a part of the</i> Great Bear, known to every country boy and
girl in the northern half of the world. This is, perhaps, the
most important star group in our sky, because of its size,
peculiar form, the fact that it never sets in our latitude,
and that of its stars, two, sometimes called the Pointers
always point out the Pole Star. It is called the Dipper
because it is shaped like a dipper with a long, bent handle.</p>

<p>Why (<i>the whole group</i>) is called the Great Bear is not
so easy to explain. The classical legend has it that the
nymph, Calisto, having violated her vow, was changed by
Diana into a bear, which, after death, was immortalized
in the sky by Zeus. Another suggestion is that the earliest
astronomers, the Chaldeans, called these stars "the shining
ones," and their word happened to be very like the
Greek <i>arktos</i> (a bear). Another explanation is that vessels
in olden days were named for animals, etc. They
bore at the prow the carved effigy of the namesake, and
if the Great Bear, for example, made several very happy
voyages by setting out when a certain constellation was
in the ascendant, that constellation might become known
as the Great Bear's constellation. Certainly, there is
nothing in its shape to justify the name. Very few of
the constellations indeed are like the thing they are called
after. Their names were usually given for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
fanciful association with the namesake, rather than for
resemblance to it.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;"><a name="stars" id="stars"></a>
<a href="images/stars-big.png"><img src="images/stars.png" width="352" height="500" alt="Constellations" title="" /></a>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>The pole-star is really the most important of the stars
in our sky; it marks the north at all times; all the other
stars seem to swing around it once in twenty-four hours.
It is the end of the Little Bear's tail; this constellation
is sometimes called the Little Dipper. But the Pole-star
or Polaris, is not a very bright one, and it would be
hard to identify but for the help of the Pointers of the
Big Dipper.</p>

<p>The outside stars (Alpha and Beta) of the Dipper
point nearly to Polaris, at a distance equal to five times
the space that separates these two stars of the Dipper's
outer side.</p>

<p>Indian names for the Pole-star are the "Home Star,"
and "The Star That Never Moves," and the Big Dipper
they call the "Broken Back."</p>

<p>The great Bear is also to be remembered as the hour-hand
of the woodman's clock. It goes once around the
North Star in about twenty-four hours, the same way as
the sun, and for the same reason&mdash;that it is the earth
that is going and leaving them behind.</p>

<p>The time in going around is not exactly twenty-four
hours, so that the position of the Pointers varies with
the seasons, but, as a rule, this for woodcraft purposes
is near enough. The bowl of the Dipper swings four-fifths
of the width of its own opening in one hour. If
it went a quarter of the circle, that would mean you had
slept a quarter of a day, or six hours.</p>

<p>Every fifteen days the stars seem to be an hour earlier:
in three months they gain one-fourth of the circle, and
in a year gain the whole circle.</p>

<p>According to Flammarion, there are about seven thousand
stars visible to the naked eye, and of these twenty
are stars of the first magnitude. Fourteen of them are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
visible in the latitude of New York, the others (those
starred) belong to the South Polar region of the sky. The
following table of the brightest stars is taken from the
Revised Harvard Photometry of 1908, the best authority
on the subject.</p>

</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>OTHER CONSTELLATIONS</b></div>

<p>Orion (O-ri-on), with its striking array of brilliant
stars, Betelgeuze, Rigel, the Three Kings, etc., is generally
admitted to be the first constellation in the heavens.</p>

<p>Orion was the hunter giant who went to Heaven when
he died, and now marches around the great dome, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
is seen only in the winter, because during the summer,
he passes over during daytime. Thus he is still the
hunter's constellation. The three stars of his belt are
called the "Three Kings."</p>

<p>Sirius, the Great Dog-Star, is in the head of Orion's
Hound, the constellation <i>Canis Major</i>, and following
farther back is the Little Dog-Star, Procyon, the chief
star of the constellation <i>Canis Minor</i>.</p>

<p>In old charts of the stars, Orion is shown with his
hounds, hunting the bull, Taurus. This constellation is
recognizable by this diagram; the red star, Aldebaran, being
the angry right eye of the Bull. His face is covered
with a cluster of little stars called the <i>Hyades</i>, and on
his shoulder are the seven stars, called <i>Pleiades</i>.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Pleiades</b></div>

<p><i>Pleiades</i> (Ply-a-des) can be seen in winter as a cluster
of small stars between Aldebaran and Angol, or, a line
drawn from the back bottom, through the front rim of
the Big Dipper, about two Dipper lengths, touches this
little group. They are not far from Aldebaran, being
in the right shoulder of the Bull. They may be considered
the seven arrow wounds made by Orion.</p>

<p>Serviss tells us that the <i>Pleiades</i> have a supposed connection
with the Great Pyramid, because "about 2170
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the beginning of spring coincided with the
culmination of the Pleiades at midnight, that wonderful
group of stars was visible just at midnight, through the
mysterious southward-pointing passage of the Pyramid."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Cassiopeia</b></div>

<p>On the opposite side of the Polar-star from the Big
Dipper and nearly as far from it, is a W of five bright
stars. This is called the <i>Cassiopeia's Chair</i>. It is easily
found and visible the year round on clear nights.</p>

<p>Thus we have described ten constellations from which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the woodcrafter may select the number needed to qualify,
namely, the Little Bear, or Little Dipper, the Big
Dipper or Big Bear, Cassiopeia's Chair, the Bull, Orion's
Hound, Orion's Little Dog, the Pleiades and the Hyades;
the Lyre (later).</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Moon</b></div>

<p>The moon is one-fourth the diameter of the earth,
about one-fiftieth of the bulk, and is about a quarter of a
million miles away. Its course, while very irregular, is
nearly the same as the apparent course of the sun. It is
a cold solid body, without any known atmosphere, and
shines by reflected sunlight.</p>

<p>The moon goes around the earth in twenty-seven and a
quarter days. It loses about fifty-one minutes in twenty-fours
hours; therefore it rises that much later each successive
night on the average, but there are wide deviations
from this average, as for example, the time of
the Harvest and Hunter's moons in the fall, when the
full moon rises at nearly the same time for several nights
in succession.</p>

<p>According to most authorities, the moon is a piece of
the earth that broke away some time ago; and it has
followed its mother around ever since.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Stars as Tests of Eyesight</b></div>

<p>In the sky are several tests of eyesight which have
been there for some time and are likely to be. The first
is the old test of Mizar and Alcor. Mizar, the Horse,
is the star at the bend of the handle of the Dipper. Just
above it is a very small star that astronomers call Alcor,
or the rider.</p>

<p>The Indians call these two the "Old Squaw and the
Papoose on Her Back." In the old world, from very
ancient times, these have been used as tests of eyesight.
To be able to see Alcor with the naked eye means that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
one has excellent eyesight. So also on the plains, the
old folks would ask the children at night, "Can you see
the papoose on the old Squaw's back?" And when the
youngster saw it and proved that he did by a right
description, they rejoiced that he had the eyesight which
is the first requisite of a good hunter.</p>

<p>One of the oldest of all eye tests is the Pleiades. Poor
eyes see a mere haze, fairly good see five, good see six,
excellent see seven. The rarest eyesight, under the best
conditions, see up to ten; and, according to Flammarion,
the record with unaided eyes is thirteen.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Vega of the Lyre</b></div>

<p>If one draw a line from through the back wall of the
Dipper, that is, from the back bottom star, through the
one next the handle, and continue it upward for twice
the total length of the Dipper, it will reach Vega, the
brightest star in the northern part of the sky, and believed
to have been at one time the Pole-star&mdash;and likely
to be again. Vega, with the two stars near it, form a
small triangle. The one on the side next the North Star
is called Epsillon. If you have remarkably good eyes,
you will see that it is a double star.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Nebula in Orion's Sword</b></div>

<p>Just about the middle of Orion's Sword is a fuzzy
light spot. This might do for blood, only it is the wrong
color. It is the nebula of Orion. If you can see it with
the naked eye, you are to be congratulated.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>On the Moon</b></div>

<p>When the moon is full, there is a large, dark, oval spot
on it to the left, as you face it, and close to the east rim,
almost halfway up; this is the Plain of Grimaldi; it is
about twice the size of the whole State of New Jersey;
but it is proof of a pair of excellent eyes if you can see
it at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i044.png" width="450" height="661" alt="SIGNS AND BLAZES" title="" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Blazes</b></div>

<p>First among the trail signs that are used by Woodcrafters,
Indians, and white hunters, and most likely to
be of use to the traveler, are axe blazes on tree trunks.
Among these some may vary greatly with locality, but
there is one that I have found everywhere in use with
scarcely any variation. That is the simple white spot
meaning, "<i>Here is the trail.</i>"</p>

<p>The Indian in making it may nick off an infinitesimal
speck of bark with his knife, the trapper with his hatchet
may make it as big as a dollar, or the settler with his
heavy axe may stab off half the tree-side; but the sign is
the same in principle and in meaning, on trunk, log, or
branch from Atlantic to Pacific and from Hudson Strait
to Rio Grande. "This is your trail," it clearly says in
the universal language of the woods.</p>

<p>There are two ways of employing it: one when it
appears on back and front of the trunk, so that the trail
can be run both ways; the other when it appears on but
one side of each tree, making a <i>blind trail</i>, which can be
run one way only, the blind trail is often used by trappers
and prospectors, who do not wish anyone to follow their
back track.</p>

<p>But there are treeless regions where the trail must be
marked; regions of sage brush and sand, regions of rock,
stretches of stone, and level wastes of grass or sedge.
Here other methods must be employed.</p>

<p>A well-known Indian device, in the brush, is to break a
twig and leave it hanging. (<i>Second line.</i>)</p>

<p>Among stones and rocks the recognized sign is one
stone set on top of another (<i>top line</i>) and in places where
there is nothing but grass the custom is to twist a tussock
into a knot (<i>third line</i>).</p>

<p>These signs are also used in the whole country from

<p>In running a trail one naturally looks straight ahead
for the next sign; if the trail turned sharply without
notice one might easily be set wrong, but custom has provided
against this. The tree blaze for turn "to the right"
is shown in No. 2, fourth row; "to the left" in No. 3.
The greater length of the turning blaze seems to be due
to a desire for emphasis as the same mark set square on,
is understood to mean "Look out, there is something of
special importance here." Combined with a long side chip
means "very important; here turn aside." This is often
used to mean "camp is close by," and a third sign that
is variously combined always with the general meaning
of "warning" or "something of great importance" is a
threefold blaze. (No. 4 on fourth line.) The combination
(No. 1 on bottom row) would read "Look out now
for something of great importance to the right." This
blaze I have often seen used by trappers to mark the
whereabouts of their trap or cache.</p>

<p>Surveyors often use a similar mark&mdash;that is, three
simple spots and a stripe to mean, "There is a stake close
at hand," while a similar blaze on another tree nearby
means that the stake is on a line between.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Stone Signs</b></div>

<p>These signs done into stone-talk would be as in the
top line of the cut.</p>

<p>These are much used in the Rockies where the trail
goes over stony places or along stretches of slide rock.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Grass and Twig Signs</b></div>

<p>In grass or sedge the top of the tuft is made to show
the direction to be followed; if it is a point of great
importance three tufts are tied, their tops straight if the
trail goes straight on; otherwise the tops are turned in
the direction toward which the course turns.</p>

<p>The Ojibways and other woodland tribes use twigs for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
a great many of these signs. (<i>See second row.</i>) The
hanging broken twig like the simple blaze means "This
is the trail." The twig clean broken off and laid on the
ground across the line of march means, "Here break from
your straight course and go in the line of the butt end,"
and when an especial <i>warning</i> is meant, the butt is pointed
toward the one following the trail and raised somewhat,
in a forked twig. If the butt of the twig were raised
and pointing to the left, it would mean "Look out, camp,
or ourselves, or the enemy, or the game we have killed
is out that way." With some, the elevation of the butt
is made to show the distance of the object; if low the
object is near, if raised very high the object is a long
way off.</p>

<p>These are the principal signs of the trail used by Woodcrafters,
Indians, and hunters in most parts of America.
These are the standards&mdash;the ones sure to be seen by
those who camp in the wilderness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Signal by Shots</b></div>

<p>The old buffalo hunters had an established signal that
is yet used by the mountain guides. It is as follows:</p>

<p>Two shots in rapid succession, an interval of five seconds
by the watch, then one shot; this means, "where
are you?" The answer given at once and exactly the
same means "Here I am; what do you want?" The reply
to this may be one shot, which means, "All right; I
only wanted to know where you were." But if the reply
repeats the first it means, "I am in serious trouble; come
as fast as you can."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Totems in Town</b></div>

<p>A totem is an emblem of a man, a group of men, or
an idea. It has no reference to words or letters.</p>

<p>Before men knew how to write they needed marks to
indicate ownership. This mark must be simple and legible
and was chosen because of something connected with
the owner or his family. Later some of the trades adopted
a symbol; for instance the barbers in the early days
were "blood letters" and were closely associated with the
medical profession. Their totem indicate their business
and we have the red and white barber pole of today. It
was among the Indians along the West coast of America
that the science and art of totems reached its highest
development, though they have a world-wide usage and
go back in history to the earliest times.</p>

<p>Out of this use of totems as owner marks and signs
grew the whole science of heraldry and national flags.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

<span class="caption">Totems Often Seen</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Thanks to the fusion of many small armies into one
or two big armies, that is, of many tribes into a nation,
and also to modern weapons which made it possible to
kill a man farther off than you could see the totem on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
his shield, national flags have replaced the armorial devices,
and are the principal totems used today.</p>

<p>But a new possibility has been discovered in modern
times. Totems will serve the ends of commerce, and a
great revival of their use is now seen.</p>

<p>The totem is visible such a long way off and is understood
by all, whether or not they can read or know our
language, is copyrightable and advertisable, so that most
of the great railway companies, etc., now have totems.</p>

<p>There are not less than one hundred common totems
used in our streets today. Among the familiar ones seen
are the American eagle, with white head and tail, the
Austrian eagle with two heads, the British lion, the Irish
harp, the French fleur de lis, etc. Among trades the three
balls of the pawnbroker, the golden fleece of the dry-goods
man, the mortar and pestle of the druggist, and
others are well known. Examples of these and others
are given in the illustration but any wideawake Woodcraft
Girl will be able to find many others by careful
observation.</p>

<br />
<i>Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,</i><br />
<i>It is to grow in the open air, and to eat and sleep with the earth.</i><br />
</div>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<i>Walt Whitman.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A Girl Scout likes to hike and camp. She learns
to know the stars, and becomes acquainted with the
plants and animals about her. She gains independence
from her ability to help herself, and health and
strength from exercise in the sunshine and fresh air.</p>

<p>These are the good things of camping. The bad
things are catching cold from damp ground, or insufficient
bedding, uncomfortable nights, and weary feet.
But a wise Scout does not rough it. She knows how
to make herself comfortable by a hundred little dodges.
The aim of camping is to make things simpler for the
Camper. She must make up her mind whether she is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
ready for an overnight hike, a week-end trip or a good
vacation in the open air, and plan accordingly.</p>

<p>For a walking trip a Girl Scout must travel light and
learn to do with a minimum amount of clothing, utensils
and food. On the other hand, if she is going to
spend the week out, why not be as comfortable as possible?
This requires more of an outfit, but it is worth it.
To know how to do this one must, of course, have first
learned the simple rules of camping in Girl Scout training.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Hiking</b></div>

<p>Hikes are a good way to get this training. Extreme
heat, or a downpour of rain is the only kind of weather
which should interfere with a hike. Soft rains or
snowstorms are very pleasant to hike in.</p>

<p>Skirts are dangerous for cross-country travel on account
of brambles, rock work and climbing over brooks.
Knickerbockers or bloomers should be worn.</p>

<p><i>In the city</i> when starting off for a hike use squad or
double file formation through the streets, railroad stations,
ferries, etc. Silence is maintained in this formation.</p>

<p><i>Hiking Order</i>&mdash;In the country, even along unused
roads, hike in single file on the left side of the road. The
advantage of this formation is that all danger from passing
traffic in any direction is averted. It is <i>not</i> necessary
to keep step, and talking, laughing, singing, etc., may be
indulged in. Permission to break this order is only given
when in woods, or fields, where there is no danger.</p>

<p>When returning home use Scout's Pace if weary.
This helps to make the distance seem shorter.</p>

<p><i>Scout's pace</i> is a walking and running device which
serves to increase endurance when covering a long distance.
It consists in taking a certain number of walking
steps followed immediately by the same number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
running steps, returning to the walking steps, and so
forth. The number of steps may vary, according to
the place, nature of the road and object of the walk.
Fifty steps walking, fifty steps running and alternating
steadily for twelve minutes will take one a mile, and
this is one of the measures of distance that is useful to
know. For ordinary use on hikes the use of twenty
steps running and walking is preferable.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Feet</b></div>

<p>With a little knowledge as to the care of her feet the
city girl can make a good showing at her first camp.
Prepare feet by brushing vigorously with a dry flesh
brush. Strengthen muscles by standing on toes in bare
feet, raising body gradually fifty or seventy-five times.
Frequent changes of stockings, bathing of tired feet in
hot water at night and cold water in the morning, will
overcome most of the hiker's troubles. The cold water
hardens the skin. Boric acid powder is good for naturally
damp feet. Blisters should be cleansed with
iodine, then carefully pricked with a sterile needle to let
out the water (hold the needle in the flame of a match),
then washed with iodine and covered with a few layers
of sterile gauze fastened with adhesive plaster.</p>

<p>It is desirable to change the stockings every day. Wash
them at night and hang them out to dry and keep them
well darned. Two pairs at least are necessary. Never
risk your health by putting on stockings even slightly
damp with dew. A hole will cause a blister. Woolen
stockings are preferable. For very long hikes it helps
to wear two or three pairs, and to lather the outside of
the stocking with a cake of soap slightly moistened.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Shoes</b></div>

<p>Shoes should be the shape of the feet and have low,
wide heels. It rests the feet to take the shoes off once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
or twice during a long tramp. Grease the shoes every
few days with mutton fat or other grease. There is no
such thing as waterproof leather, but it can be made so
by being greased. After being wet, shoes should be well
dried and greased, but should not be dried in a hot place,
for this would ruin the leather. These may seem trifling
details, but remember, "no army is stronger than its
feet."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Things to Remember</b></div>

<p>Keep the feet straight when walking. If a Girl Scout
notices the tracks of an Indian, the first hikers in this
country, she will find them invariably straight forward.
Scientists have agreed that the dancing school habit of
turning out toes is one of the causes of flat feet, which
disqualified so many men for army service.</p>

<p>Start the walk slowly. Keep the pace of the slowest
of the party. "Slow and easy goes far in a day." Practice
deep breathing. Inhale for five steps, hold your
breath for five counts, and let it out, again counting five.</p>

<p>Take short steps when climbing. Do not run down
hill. It causes stiffness, for which a hot bath and another
walk the next day are the best cure.</p>

<p>When lunch is carried it should be divided among the
troop. Each Scout should carry her knapsack on her
back, to leave the hands free. It is a great mistake to
start on a hike with one's arms laden.</p>

<p>Do not plan to go too great a distance in the time at
your disposal. Remember that aside from the time you
need for going and coming you expect to enjoy yourselves
cooking and eating, and you need time for both.
For an over-night hike, when you carry your equipment
select a spot not more than two miles distant.</p>

<p>Good things to carry in one's pocket are a drinking
cup, a geological survey map (ten cents), a small pocket<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
compass, a camper's knife, a small soapstone to sharpen
it, a match box, and a note-book and pencil.</p>

<p>Plan a definite object for the hike. Note how many
kinds of trees, wild flowers or birds one can find.</p>

<p>Practice building fires for cooking, or getting material
for a bed such as balsam, etc. Inquire for points of
historical interest and make them the goal of the hike.
There is hardly a town that has not some place connected
with the early history of the nation.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Personal Equipment</b></div>

<p>Spending the nights under the stars is one of the great
fascinations of camping. Each person requires two
waterproof ground cloths or ponchos, two pairs of light
wool blankets, safety pins, heavy cord, sleeping garments,
rain coat, and toilet articles, including such things
as soap, toilet paper, sewing kit, electric flashlight, mirror,
first aid kit, provision for mosquitoes or flies, five
yards of bar netting, and oil of citronella.</p>

<p>In order to ensure protection from the rain spread one
waterproof covering or poncho on the ground using half
underneath so that the upper half may be folded over
the head in case of rain. Put blankets <i>under</i> as well as
<i>over</i> you, and a second waterproof covering over the
blankets.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Clothing</b></div>

<p>When living out of doors, one may make shift for
shelter, or even go hungry for a space, but there is no
substitute for comfortable clothing that is safe to use
if one would keep well. Horace Kephart, the master
camper, devotes much space to this subject, and we can
do no better than to follow his advice from Camping
and Woodcraft.</p>

<p>"* * * One soon learns that the difference between
comfort and misery, if not health and illness, may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
depend on whether he is properly clad. Proper, in this
case does not mean modish, but suitable, serviceable,
proven by the touchstone of experience to be best for
the work or play that is in hand. When you seek a guide
in the mountains, he looks first in your eyes and then
at your shoes. If both are right, you are right.</p>

<p>"The chief uses of clothing are to help the body maintain
its normal temperature and to protect it from sun,
frost, wind, rain and injuries. <i>To help</i>, mind you&mdash;the
body must be allowed to do its share.</p>

<p>"Perspiration is the heat-regulating mechanism of the
body. Clothing should hinder its passage from the skin
as little as possible. For this reason one's garments
should be <i>permeable</i> to air. The body is cooled by rapid
evaporation, on the familiar principle of a tropical water
bag that is porous enough to let some of the water exude.
So the best summer clothing is that which permits free
evaporation&mdash;and this means all over, from head to heel.
In winter it is just the same, there should be free passage
for bodily moisture through the underclothes, but extra
layers or thickness of outer clothing are needed to hold
in the bodily heat and to protect one against wind; even
so all the garments should be permeable to air. * * *"</p>

<p>"Underclothing, for any season, should be loosely
woven, so as to hold air and take up moisture from the
body. The air confined in the interspaces is a non-conductor,
and so helps to prevent sudden chilling on the
one hand, and over-heating on the other. A loose texture
absorbs perspiration but does not hold it&mdash;the moisture
is free to pass on to and through the outer garments.
In town we may indure close woven underwear in summer,
if thin enough, because we exercise little and can
bathe and change frequently. In the woods we would
have to change four times a day to keep * * * as dry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Wool versus Cotton</i>&mdash;Permeability also depends upon
material. Ordinary cotton and linen goods do not permit
rapid evaporation. They absorb moisture from the
skin, but hold it up to the limit of saturation. Then,
when they can hold no more, they are clammy, and the
sweat can only escape by running down one's skin.</p>

<p>"After hard exertion in such garments, if you sit
down to rest, or meet a sudden keen wind, as in topping a
ridge, you are likely to get a chill&mdash;and the next thing
is a 'bad cold' or lumbago, rheumatism, or something
worse.</p>

<p>"Wool, on the contrary is permeable. That is why (if
of suitable weight and loose weave) it is both cooler in
summer and warmer in winter than cloth made of vegetable
fibre. 'One wraps himself in a woolen blanket to
keep warm&mdash;to keep the heat <i>in</i>. He wraps ice in a
blanket to keep it from melting&mdash;to keep the heat <i>out</i>.'
In other words, wool is the best material to maintain an
equable normal temperature."</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Camp Site</b></div>

<p>"The essentials of a good camp site are these:</p>

<p>1. Pure water.</p>

<p>2. Wood that burns well. In cold weather there
should be either an abundance of sound down wood, or
some standing hard wood trees that are not too big for
easy felling.</p>

<p>3. An open spot level enough for the tent and camp
fire, but elevated above its surroundings so as to have
good natural drainage. It must be well above any chance
overflow from the sudden rise of a neighboring stream.
Observe the previous flood marks....</p>

<p>7. Exposure to direct sunlight during a part of the
day, especially during the early morning hours.</p>

<p>8. In summer, exposure to whatever breezes may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
blow; in cold weather, protection against the prevailing
wind.</p>

<p>9. Privacy.</p>

<p>"Water, wood, and good drainage may be all you need
for a 'one-night stand,' but the other points, too, should
be considered when selecting a site for a fixed camp.<br /><br /></p>

<p>"<i>Water</i>&mdash;Be particularly careful about the purity of
your water supply. You come, let us say, to a mountain
brook, that issues from thick forest. It ripples over clean
rocks, it bubbles with air, it is clear as crystal and cool
to your thirsty throat. 'Surely that is good water.' But
do you know where it comes from? Every mountain
cabin is built close to a spring-branch. Somewhere up
that branch there may be a clearing; in that clearing, a
house; in that house, a case of dysentery or typhoid
fever. I have known several cases of infection from
just such a source. It is not true that running water
purifies itself.</p>

<p>"When one must use well-water let him note the surrounding
drainage. If the well is near a stable or out
house, or if dish water is thrown near it, let it alone. A
well in sandy soil is more or less filtered by nature, but
rocky or clayey earth may conduct disease germs a considerable
distance under ground. Never drink from the
well of an abandoned farm: there is no telling what may
have fallen into it.</p>

<p>"A spring issuing from the living rock is worthy of
confidence. Even if it be but a trickle you can scoop
out a basin to receive it that soon will clear itself.</p>

<p>"Sometimes a subaqueous spring may be found near
the margin of a lake or river by paddling close in shore
and trailing your hand in the water. When a cold spot
is noted, go ashore and dig a few feet back from the
water's edge. I have found such spring exit in the
Mississippi some distance from the bank, and by weight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>ing
a canteen, tying a string to it and another to the
stopper, have brought up cool water from the river bed.</p>

<p>"Disease germs are of animal, not vegetable origin.
Still waters are not necessarily unwholesome, even though
there is rotten vegetation in them. The water of cedar
and cypress swamps is good to drink wherever there is
a deep pool of it, unless polluted from some outside
source. Lake water is safe if no settlements are on its
border; but even so large a body as Lake Champlain has
been condemned by state boards of health because of the
sewage that runs into it.</p>

<p>"When a stream is in flood it is likely to be contaminated
by decayed animal matter.</p>

<p>"<i>Alkaline Water</i>&mdash;When traveling in an alkali country
carry some vinegar or limes or lemons, or (better)
a glass stoppered bottle of hydrochloric acid. One teaspoonful
of hydrochloric (muriatic) neutralizes about a
gallon of water, and if there should be a little excess it
will do no harm but rather assist digestion. In default
of acid you may add a little Jamaica ginger and sugar
to the water, making a weak ginger tea.</p>

<p>"<i>Muddy Water</i>&mdash;I used to clarify Mississippi water by
stirring corn meal in it and letting it settle, or by stirring
a lump of alum in it until the mud began to precipitate,
and then decanting the clear water. Lacking these, one
can take a good handful of grass, tie it roughly in the
form of a cone six or eight inches high, invert it, pour
water slowly into the grass and a runnel of comparatively
clear water will trickle down through the small
end.</p>

<p>"<i>Stagnant Water</i>&mdash;A traveler may be reduced to the
extremity of using stagnant or even putrid water; but
this should never be done without first boiling it. Some
charred wood from the camp fire should be boiled with
the water; then skim off the scum, strain, and set in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
water aside to cool. Boiling sterilizes, and charcoal
deodorizes. * * *"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i048.jpg" width="400" height="230" alt="COOKING THE FIRST MEAL" title="" />
<span class="caption">COOKING THE FIRST MEAL</span>
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Arriving at Camp</b></div>

<p>As soon as the camp site is decided upon locate the
tent. (This should be done in advance when the party
is of any size). Each tent should be about twenty-five
feet from the next, on a dry place and easy to drain in
case of rain, and so placed as to have the sun in the
morning and the shade in the afternoon. Each tent
should be trenched and placed some distance from the
water supply and from the latrine.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Tents</b></div>

<p>"For fixed camps, situated where there are wagon
roads or other adequate means of transportation, the
best cloth shelter is a wall tent, rectangular or square,
of strong and rather heavy material. * * * The best
all-round size of wall tent for two people, if weight and
bulk and cost are of any consequence, is the so-called
9 &times; 9 or a 9 &times; 12, built with 3-1/2-foot walls, instead of
3-foot, and 8-foot center, instead of 7-1/2-foot. For four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
persons a 12 &times; 14 is commonly used; but a 14 &times; 14 with
4-foot walls and a 9-foot center has double the head-room
of the standard 12 &times; 14, and 2-1/2 feet more space between
cots, if these are set lengthwise of the tent, two on a side.</p>

<p>"Before selecting a tent, consider the number of people
to occupy it and their dunnage, and the furniture. Then
draw diagrams of floor and elevation of various sizes,
putting in the cots, etc., according to scale; so you can
get just what you want, no more, no less.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Camp Sanitation</b></div>

<p>"Nothing is cleaner, sweeter, wholesomer, than a wildwood
unspoiled by man, and few spots are more disgusting
than a "piggy" camp, with slops thrown everywhere,
empty cans and broken bottles littering the ground, and
organic refuse left festering in the sun, breeding disease
germs, to be spread abroad by the swarms of flies. I
have seen one of nature's gardens, an ideal health resort,
changed in a few months by a logging crew into an
abomination and a pest hole where typhoid and dysentery
wrought deadly vengeance.</p>

<p>"<i>Destroy at once all refuse that would attract flies.</i>
Or bury it where they cannot get at it.</p>

<p>"Fire is the absolute disinfectant. Burn all solid
kitchen refuse as fast as it accumulates. When a can
of food is emptied toss it on the fire and burn it out, then
drop it in a sink hole that you have dug for slops and unburnable
trash, and cover it with earth or ashes so no
mosquitoes can breed in it after a rainfall.</p>

<p>"The sink should be on the down hill side of camp,
and where it cannot pollute the water supply. Sprinkle
kerosene on it or burn it out frequently with a brush
fire. * * *"</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Latrine</b></div>

<p>One of the first tasks of the camper is to dig a trench
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>for a latrine and build a screen around it. The latrine
should be on a lower level than the camp, away from the
water supply and in the opposite direction from which
the prevailing winds come toward the camp, two hundred
feet from sleeping and mess tents. Bushes or a tent fly
may be used as a screen and shelter. A small lean-to
serves admirably. Dig trenches four feet long, one foot
wide and two feet deep. Allow six inches (length) per
day for a Scout. Cover after using with fresh dirt. It
is imperative to fill and re-sod all trenches dug. Whether
you camp only for lunch or for the summer leave no
trace that you have been there. Remember the animals
how they scratch the soil and cover up any waste that
they leave, and be at least as clean as they.</p>

<p>Lime does not keep the flies away. Plenty of fresh
dirt is better.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Team Work</b></div>

<p>Only as each and every member does her part will the
camp be a complete success. The daily tasks should be
assigned to individuals or groups, as in:</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Pine Tree Patrol System</b></div>

<p>The chief advantage of this system is that whenever
the need for work of any description arises, there is always
someone whose duty is to perform that particular
task, thus avoiding the inevitable question of "Who will
do it?" The Pine Tree Patrol system does not in the
least interfere with regular schedule of Scout activities;
on the contrary, it saves time since more than one hand
on each spoke of the wheel keeps it in continual motion.
When the system seems too complicated for a small camp,
the captain can simplify it to suit the circumstances.</p>

<p>Each girl in the Patrol is assigned a number which

<p>The front rank (Reds) is in touch with and under the Senior
(Patrol Leader); the rear rank (Blues) is in touch with and
under the Junior. The Senior receives her orders from the
Captain and transmits them not only to 3, 5 and 7, but to Junior
as well. The Senior and ranking Patrol officer keeps an eye
on the Junior and her rear rank. The Captain, of course, is the
general overseer, but the Senior <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'as'">has</ins> charge of all routine troop
duties, superintends camp details and is virtually a first Lieutenant
to the Captain. The Junior is a second Lieutenant and
assists the Senior in the supervision of the camp.</p>

<p><i>The Senior</i> (No. 1) looks after the flags, tentage, blankets,
equipment and personal baggage, while the Junior (No. 2) has
charge of food, fires, water, cooking, and kitchen work. They
appease the demands of the outer and inner man.</p>

<p><i>The Scribe</i> (No. 3)&mdash;She is secretary, bookkeeper, log writer,
recorder, correspondent, tent pitcher and First-Aid Scout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Baker</i> (No. 4) is the Junior's first aid. She is charged
with the care and use of cereal foodstuffs all the way from corn
on the cob to flap-jacks and "sinkers," and the cooking outfit
and kitchen fire.</p>

<p><i>The Lighter</i> (No. 5) has care of the lamps, lanterns, candles,
matches, oils and all "leaky" stuff. She understands telegraphy
and electricity and is chief signal Scout and assistant tent pitcher.
She must keep the camp well illuminated.</p>

<p><i>The Water Scout</i> (No. 6) locates water for all purposes and
carries it to camp. She acts as Fire Chief and Fire Watchman.
She provides and cooks meat, vegetables and "greens."</p>

<p><i>The Handy Scout</i> (No. 7) is field engineer, carpenter, bridge
builder, the general maker, mender, patcher, splicer and tinker;
cares for tools and trek-cart, mends the tents and clothing, and
makes the furniture.</p>

<p><i>The Wood Scout</i> (Patrol Mascot) (No. 8) is usually the
youngest girl. She keeps fires well fed, the rations dry and
the garbage burned. She carries a spade, pick axe and cutting
axe.</p>

<p>This system may be used in either a small or large camp;
if the latter, corresponding numbers of each Patrol work together.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Caution in Use of Knife and Axe</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><i>The Knife</i></div>

<p>1. Always whittle away from you.</p>

<p>2. Keep your fingers behind the blade.</p>

<p>3. Keep saying to yourself: "If this knife slips, can
it cut my fingers?"</p>

<p>4. Learn how to sharpen your knife and keep it sharp.</p>

<div class='unindent'><i>The Chopping Block</i></div>

<p>"A chopping block is the first thing needed about a
camp. The axe, when not in use, should always be
stuck in that particular block, where one can find it
when wanted, and where it will not injure men or dogs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'><i>The Axe</i></div>

<p>"Do not let the axe lie outdoors on a very cold night;
the frost would make it brittle, so that the steel might
shiver on the first knot you struck the next morning...."</p>

<p>The axe is a most dangerous tool, and a glancing blow
may cripple one for life.</p>

<p>1. Do not put your foot on a stick you are chopping.</p>

<p>2. Always have in mind where a glancing blow may
throw the axe, and keep your foot away from that
danger.</p>

<p>3. In splitting short sticks for kindling hold them by
one end flat on the chopping block and strike the blade
into the other end.</p>

<p>4. Do not hold the stick on end in one hand while
splitting it.</p>

<p>5. Cut or split small wood on a chopping block or log.
Never let the axe strike into the ground, as a hidden stone
may ruin the edge.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>The Camp Fire</b></div>

<p>"The forest floor is always littered with old leaves,
dead sticks and fallen trees. During a drought this
rubbish is so tinder-dry that a spark falling in it may start
a conflagration; but through a great part of the year the
leaves and sticks that lie flat on the ground are too moist
at least on their under side, to ignite readily. If we rake
together a pile of leaves, cover it higgledy-piggledy with
dead twigs and branches picked up at random, and set a
match to it, the odds are that it will result in nothing but
a quick blaze that soon dies down to a smudge. Yet that
is the way most of us tried to make our first outdoor fires.</p>

<p>"One glance at a camper's fire tells what kind of a
woodsman he is. It is quite impossible to prepare a
good meal over a heap of smoking chunks, a fierce blaze,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
or a great bed of coals that will warp iron and melt
everything else.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i050.png" width="400" height="136" alt="LUNCHEON FIRE" title="" />
<span class="caption">LUNCHEON FIRE</span>
</div>

<p>"If one would have good meals cooked out of doors,
and would save much time and vexation; in other words,
if he wants to be comfortable in the woods, he must learn
how to produce at will either (1) a quick, hot little fire
that will boil water in a jiffy, and will soon burn down
to embers that are not too ardent for frying; or (2) a
solid bed of long-lived coals that will keep up a steady,
glowing, smokeless heat for baking, roasting or slow
boiling; or (3) a big log fire that will throw its heat forward
on the ground, and into a tent or lean-to, and will
last several hours without replenishing.</p>

<p>"<i>Luncheon Fire</i>&mdash;For a noonday lunch, or any other
quick meal, when you have only to boil coffee and fry
something, a large fire is not wanted. Drive a forked
stake into the ground, lay a green stick across it, slanting
upward from the ground, and weight the lower end
with a rock, so that you could easily regulate the height
of a pot. The slanting stick should be notched, or have
the stub of a twig left at its upper end, to hold the pot
in place, and to be set at such an angle that the pot
swings about a foot clear of the ground.</p>

<p>"Then gather a small armful of sound, dry twigs from
the size of a lead pencil to that of your finger. Take
no twig that lies flat on the ground, for such are generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
damp or rotten. Choose hard wood, if there is any, for
it lasts well.</p>

<p>"Select three of your best sticks for kindling. Shave
each of them almost through, for half its length, leaving
lower end of shavings attached to the stick, one
under the other. Stand these in a tripod, under the
hanging pot, with their curls down. Around them
build a <i>small</i> conical wigwam of the other sticks, standing
each on end and slanting to a common center. The
whole affair is no bigger than your hat. Leave free
air spaces between the sticks. Fire requires air, and
plenty of it, and it burns best when it has something
to climb up on; hence the wigwam construction. Now
touch off the shaved sticks, and in a moment you will
have a small blast furnace under the pot. This will
get up steam in a hurry. Feed it with small sticks as
needed.</p>

<p>"Meantime get two bed-sticks, four or five inches
thick, or a pair of flat rocks, to support the frying pan.
The firewood will all drop to embers soon after the
pot boils. Toss out the smoking butts, leaving only
clear, glowing coals. Put your bed-sticks on either side,
parallel and level. Set the pan on them, and fry away.
So, in twenty minutes from the time you drove your
stake, the meal will be cooked.</p>

<p>"<i>Dinner Fire</i>&mdash;First get in plenty of wood and kindling.
If you can find two large flat rocks, or several
small ones of even height use them as andirons; otherwise
lay down two short cuts off a five or six inch log,
facing you and about three feet apart. On these rocks
or billets lay two four foot logs parallel, and several
inches apart, as rests for your utensils. Arrange the
kindling between and under them, with small sticks laid
across the top of the logs, a couple of long ones lengthwise,
then more short ones across, another pair length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>wise,
and thicker short ones across. Then light it.
Many prefer to light the kindling at once and feed the
fire gradually; but I do as above, so as to have an even
glow under several pots at once, and then the sticks
will all burn down to coals together.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i051.png" width="350" height="215" alt="CAMP CRANE" title="" />
<span class="caption">CAMP CRANE</span>
</div>

<p>"This is the usual way to build a cooking fire when
there is no time to do better. The objection is that the
supporting logs must be close enough together to hold
up the pots and pans, and, being round, this leaves too
little space between them for the fire to heat the balance
evenly; besides, a pot is liable to slip and topple over.
A better way, if one has time, is to hew both the inside
surfaces and the tops of the logs flat. Space these
supports close enough together at one end for the narrowest
pot and wide enough apart at the other for the
frying pan.</p>

<p>"If you carry fire-irons much bother is saved. Simply
lay down two flat rocks or a pair of billets far
enough apart for the purpose, place the flat irons on
them, and space them to suit the utensils.</p>

<p>"If a camp grate is used, build a crisscross fire of
short sticks under it.</p>

<p>"Split wood is better than round sticks for cooking;
it catches easier and burns more easily.</p>

<p>"Camp Crane&mdash;Pots for hot water, stews, coffee, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
so on, are more manageable when hung above the fire.
The heat can easily be regulated, the pots hanging low
at first to boil quickly, and then being elevated or shifted
aside to simmer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i052.png" width="425" height="265" alt="PINE TREE HORSE" title="" />
<span class="caption">PINE TREE HORSE</span>
</div>

<p>"Set up two forked stakes about five feet apart and
four feet to the crotches. Across them lay a green
stick (lug-pole) somewhat thicker than a broomstick.
Now cut three or four green crotches from branches,
drive a nail in the small end of each, or cut a notch
in it, invert the crotches, and hang them on the lug-pole
to suspend kettles from. These pothooks are to be of
different length so that the kettle can be adjusted to
different heights above the fire, first for hard boiling,
and then for simmering. If kettles were hung from
the lug-pole itself, this adjustment could not be made,
and you would have to dismount the whole business in
order to get one kettle off.</p>

<p>"If forked stakes are not easily found in the neighborhood,
drive straight ones, then split the tops, flatten
the ends of the cross poles and insert them in the clefts
of the stakes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"You do not want a big fire to cook over. Many
and many a time I have watched old and experienced
woodsmen spoil their grub, and their tempers, too, by
trying to cook in front of a roaring winter campfire,
and have marveled at their lack of common sense. Off
to one side of such a fire, lay your bed log as above;
then shovel from the campfire enough hard coal to fill
the space between the logs within three inches of the
top. You now have a steady, even heat from end to
end; it can easily be regulated; there is level support
for every vessel; and you can wield a short-handled
frying pan over such an outdoor range without scorching
either the meat or yourself.</p>

<p>"<i>Fire for Baking</i>&mdash;For baking in a reflector, or roasting
a joint, a high fire is best, with a backing to throw
the heat forward. Sticks three feet long can be leaned
against a big log or a sheer-faced rock, and the kindlings
started under them.</p>

<p>"Often a good bed of coals is wanted. The campfire
generally supplies these, but sometimes they are
needed in a hurry, soon after camp is pitched. To get
them, <i>take sound hardwood</i>, either green or dead, and
split it into sticks of uniform thickness (say, 1-1/4-inch
face). Lay down two bed-sticks, cross these near the
end with two others, and so on up until you have a pen
a foot high. Start a fire in this pen. Then cover it
with a layer of parallel sticks laid an inch apart. Cross
this with a similar layer at right angles, and so upward
for another foot. The free draught will make a roaring
fire, and all will burn down to coals together.</p>

<p>"The thick bark of hemlock, and the hard woods generally,
will soon yield coals for ordinary cooking.</p>

<p>"To keep coals a long time, cover them with ashes,
or with bark which will soon burn to ashes. In wet
weather a bed of coals can be shielded by slanting broad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
strips of green bark over it and overlapping them at
the edges.</p>

<p>"<i>Fire in a Trench</i>&mdash;In time of drought when everything
is tinder-dry, or in windy weather, especially if
the ground be strewn with dead leaves or pine needles,
build your fire in a trench. This is the best way, too,
if fuel is scarce and you must depend on brushwood,
as a trench conserves heat.</p>

<p>"Dig the trench in line with the prevailing wind.
The point is to get a good draught. Make the windward
end somewhat wider than the rest, and deeper,
sloping the trench upward to the far end. Line the
sides with flat rocks if they are to be found, as they
hold heat a long time and keep the sides from crumbling
in. Lay other rocks, or a pair of green poles along
the edges to support vessels. A little chimney of flat
stones or sod, at the leeward end, will make the fire
draw well. If there is some sheet-iron to cover the
trench a quite practical stove is made, but an open
trench will do very well if properly managed.</p>

<p>"<i>The Indian's Fire</i>&mdash;Best where fuel is scarce, or
when one has only a small hatchet with which to cut
night wood. Fell and trim a lot of hardwood saplings.
Lay three or four of them on the ground, butts on top
of each other, tips radiating from this center like the
spokes of a wheel. On and around this build a small
hot fire. Place butts of other saplings on this, radiating
like the others. As the wood burns away, shove the
sticks in toward the center, butts on top of each other
as before. This saves much chopping, and economizes
fuel. Build a little wind break behind you and lie close
to the fire. Doubtless you have heard the Indian's
dictum (southern Indians express it just as the northern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>ones do): 'White man heap fool; make um big
fire&mdash;can't git near; Injun make um little fire&mdash;git close.
Uh, good.'</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Kindling</b></div>

<p>"The best kindling is fat pine or the bark of the paper
birch. Fat pine is found in the stumps and butt cuts
of pine trees, particularly those that died on the stump.
The resin has collected there and dried. This wood is
usually easy to split. Pine knots are the tough, heavy
resinous stubs of limbs that are found on dead pine trees.
They, as well as fat pine, are almost imperishable, and
those sticking out of old rotten logs are as good as any.
In collecting pine knots go to fallen trees that are almost
rotted away. Hit the knot a lick with the pole of the
axe and generally it will yield; if you must chop, cut deep
to get it all and to save the axe edge. The knots of old
dead balsams are similarly used. Usually a dead stump
of pine, spruce, or balsam, all punky on the outside, has
a core very rich in resin that makes excellent kindling.</p>

<p>"Hemlock knots are worthless and hard as glass&mdash;keep
your axe out of them.</p>

<p>"The thick bark of hemlock is good to make glowing
coals in a hurry; so is that of hard woods generally.
Good kindling sure to be dry underneath the bark in all
weather, is procured by snapping off the small dead
branches, or stubs of branches, that are left on the trunks
of small or medium-sized trees, near the ground. Do
not pick up twigs from the ground, but choose those
among the downwood that are held up free from the
ground. Where a tree is found that has been shivered
by lightning, or one that has broken off without uprooting,
good splinters of dry wood will be found. In every
laurel thicket there is plenty of dead laurel, and, since
it is of sprangling growth, most of the branches will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
free from the ground and snap-dry. They ignite readily
and give out intense heat.</p>

<p>"The bark of all species of birch, but of paper birch
especially, is excellent for kindling and for torches. It
is full of resinous oil, blazes up at once, will burn in any
wind, and wet sticks can be ignited with it.</p>

<p>"<i>Making Fire in the Wet</i>&mdash;It is a good test of one's
resourcefulness to make a fire out of doors in rainy
weather. The best way to go about it depends upon
local conditions. If fat pine can be found, the trick is
easy; just split it up, and start your fire under a big
fallen log. Dry fuel and a place to build a fire can
often be found under big up-tilted logs, shelving rocks,
and similar natural shelters, or in the core of an old
stump. In default of these, look for a dead softwood
tree that leans to the south. The wood and bark on the
under side will be dry; chop some off, split it fine, and
build your fire under the shelter of the trunk.</p>

<p>"<i>Lighting a Match</i>&mdash;When there is nothing dry to
strike it on, jerk the tip of the match forward against
your teeth.</p>

<p>"To light a match in the wind, <i>face</i> the wind. Cup
your hands, with their backs toward the wind, and hold
the match with its head pointing toward the rear of the
cup; <i>i. e.</i>, toward the wind. Remove the right hand
just long enough to strike the match on something very
close by; then instantly resume the former position.
The flame will run up the match stick, instead of being
blown away from it, and so will have something to feed
on.</p>

<p>"<i>Fire Regulations</i>&mdash;On state lands and on national
forest reserves it is forbidden to use any but fallen
timber for firewood. Different states have various other
restrictions, some, I believe, not permitting trampers to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
light a fire in the woods at all unless accompanied by a
registered guide.</p>

<p>"In New York the regulations prescribe that fires
will be permitted for the purposes of cooking, warmth
and insect smudges; but before such fires are kindled
sufficient space around the spot where the fire is to be
lighted must be cleared from all combustible material;
and before the place is abandoned fires so lighted must
be thoroughly quenched.</p>

<p>"In Pennsylvania forest reserves no fire may be made
except in a hole or pit one foot deep, the pit being encircled
by the excavated earth. In those of California,
no fire at all may be lighted without first procuring a
permit from the authorities.</p>

<p>"Fire regulations are posted on all public lands, and
if campers disregard them they are subject to arrest.</p>

<p>"These are wise and good laws. Every camper who
loves the forest, and who has any regard for public interest,
will do his part in obeying them to the letter.
However, if he occupies private property where he may
use his own judgment, or if he travels in the wilderness
far from civilization, where there are no regulations,
it will be useful for him to know something about the
fuel value of all kinds of wood, green as well as dead,
and for such people the following information is given:</p>

<p>"The arts of fire building are not so simple as they
look. To practice them successfully in all sorts of wild
regions we must know the different species of trees
one from another, and their relative fuel values, which
as we shall see, vary a great deal. We must know
how well, or ill, each of them burns in a green state,
as well as when seasoned. It is important to discriminate
between wood that makes lasting coals and such
as soon dies down to ashes. Some kinds of wood pop
violently when burning and cast out embers that may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
burn holes in tents and bedding or set the neighborhood
afire; others burn quietly, with clear, steady flame.
Some are stubborn to split, others almost fall apart
under the axe. In wet weather it takes a practiced
woodsman to find tinder and dry wood, and to select
a natural shelter where fire can be kept going during
a storm or rain or snow, when a fire is most needed.</p>

<p>"There are several handy little manuals by which
one who has no botanical knowledge can soon learn
how to identify the different species of trees by merely
examining their leaves, or, late in the season, by their
bark, buds and habit of growth.</p>

<p>"But no book gives the other information that I have
referred to; so I shall offer, in the present chapter, a
little rudimentary instruction in this important branch
of woodcraft.</p>

<p>"It is convenient for our purpose to divide the trees
into two great groups, hard woods and soft woods, using
these terms not so loosely as lumbermen do, but drawing
the line between sycamore, yellow birch, yellow
pine, and slippery elm, on the one side, and red cedar,
sassafras, pitch pine and white birch, on the other.</p>

<p>"<i>As a general rule</i>, hard woods make good, slow-burning
fuel that yields lasting coals, and soft woods
make a quick, hot fire that is soon spent. But each
species has peculiarities that deserve close attention.</p>

<p>"<i>Best Fuel</i>&mdash;Best of all northern fire woods is hickory,
green or dry. It makes a hot fire, but lasts a long
time, burning down to a bed of hard coals that keep
up an even, generous heat for hours. Hickory, by the
way, is distinctly an American tree; no other region on
earth produces it. The live oak of the south is most
excellent fuel; so is holly. Following the hickory, in
fuel value, are chestnut, oak, overcup, white, blackjack,
post and basket oaks, pecan, the hornbeams (iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>woods),
and dogwood. The latter burns finely to a
beautiful white ash that is characteristic; apple wood
does the same. Black birch also ranks here; it has the
advantage of 'doing its own blowing,' as a Carolina
mountaineer said to me, meaning that the oil in the
birch assists its combustion so that the wood needs no
coaxing. All of the birches are good fuel, ranking in
about this order: Black, yellow, red, paper, and white.
Sugar maple was the favorite fuel of our old-time hunters
and surveyors because it ignites easily, burns with
a clear, steady flame, and leaves good coals.</p>

<p>"Locust is a good, lasting fuel; it is easy to cut, and,
when green, splits fairly well; the thick bark takes fire
readily and the wood then burns slowly, with little
flame, leaving pretty good coals; hence it is good for
night wood. Mulberry has similar qualities. The scarlet
and willow oaks are among the poorest of the hard
woods for fuel. Cherry makes only fair fuel. White
elm is poor stuff, but slippery elm is better. Yellow
pine burns well, as its sap is resinous instead of watery
like that of the soft pines.</p>

<p>"In some respects white ash is the best of green
woods for campers fuel. It is easily cut and split, is
lighter to tote than most other woods, and is of so
dry a nature that even the green wood catches fire
readily. It burns with clear flame, and lasts longer
than any other free-burning wood of its weight. On a
wager, I have built a bully fire from a green tree of
white ash, one match, and no dry kindling. I split some
of the wood very fine and 'frilled' a few of the little
sticks with my knife.</p>

<p>"<i>Soft Woods</i>&mdash;Most of the soft woods are good only
for kindling, or for quick cooking fires, and then only
when seasoned. For these purposes, however, some of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
them are superior, as they split and shave readily and
catch fire easily.</p>

<p>"Liquidambar, magnolia, tulip, catalpa, and willow
are poor fuel. Seasoned chestnut and yellow poplar
make a hot fire, but crackle and leave no coals. Balsam
fir, basswood, and the white and loblolly pines make
quick fires, but are soon spent. The grey (Labrador)
or jack pine is considered good fuel in the far north,
where hard woods are scarce. Seasoned tamarack is
good. Spruce is poor fuel, although, being resinous,
it kindles easily and makes a good blaze for 'branding
up' a fire. Pitch pine, which is the most inflammable
of all woods when dry and 'fat,' will scarcely burn at
all in a green state. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Syacmore'">Sycamore</ins> and buckeye, when thoroughly
seasoned, are good fuel, but will not split. Alder
burns readily and gives out considerable heat, but
is not lasting.</p>

<p>"The dry wood of the northern poplar (large-toothed
aspen) is a favorite for cooking fires, because it gives
an intense heat, with little or no smoke, lasts well, and
does not blacken the utensils. Red cedar has similar
qualities, but is rather hard to ignite and must be fed
fine at the start.</p>

<p>"The best green soft woods for fuel are white birch,
paper birch, soft maple, cottonwood, and quaking aspen.</p>

<p>"As a rule, the timber growing along the margins of
large streams is softwood. Hence, driftwood is generally
a poor mainstay unless there is plenty of it on
the spot; but driftwood on the sea coast is good fuel.</p>

<p>"<i>Precautions</i>&mdash;I have already mentioned the necessity
of clearing the camp ground of inflammable stuff
before starting a fire on it, raking it toward a common
center and burning all the dead leaves, pine needles and
trash; otherwise it may catch and spread beyond your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
control as soon as your back is turned. Don't build
your fire against a big old punky log; it may smoulder
a day or two after you have left and then burst out
into flame when the breeze fans it.</p>

<p>"<i>Never</i> leave a spark of fire when breaking camp,
or when leaving it for the day. Make absolutely sure
of this by drenching the campfire thoroughly, or by
smothering it completely with earth or sand. Never
drop a lighted match on the ground without stamping it
out. Have you ever seen a forest fire? It is terrible.
Thousands of acres are destroyed and many a time men
and women and children have been cut off by a tornado
of flame and burned alive. The person whose carelessness
starts such a holocaust is worse than a fool&mdash;he is
a criminal, and a disgrace to the good earth he treads."</p>

<p>After laying the fire the legs of the grate are driven
into the ground. As the fire burns down, the grate may
be lowered by driving the legs in deeper. This is a
very useful utensil for supporting hot water pails or
frying pan.</p>

<p>When no forks can be found use the "Pine Tree
Horse," as shown in cut.</p>

<p>In order to boil water hard it will only be necessary
to slip the kettle down the pole, holding it in place by
graduated notches.</p>

<p>Equipment and supplies for one meal may be carried
in one or two haversacks like the one shown. Indeed,
a meal may be cooked without any equipment whatever
other than a knife which every Scout should be
provided with.</p>

<p><i>Improvised Grate</i>&mdash;A few sticks 1/2 inch in diameter
laid about 2 inches apart and about 2 inches above
the coals form a good enough broiler. Steak and
chops cook perfectly well if laid right on the coals.</p>

<p>Cooking kits allow for more variety, as they provide
a frying pan, in which bacon and potatoes can be cooked,
and a small pail for boiling water. It is convenient for
each Scout to carry her own cup, knife, fork and spoon.
The cooking kit and supplies can then be divided among
the party.</p>

<p>At a permanent camp a frying board is a great convenience.
It is simply a flat, smooth board with a
pointed end which can be driven into the ground. Fish,
meat, game and "Injun" bread can be cooked on this
board better than in any other way, as the food receives
the heat without becoming charred, and is much
more wholesome than when fried in a pan. As long
as the board is to windward of the flame, a constant
heat is maintained without smoke. A small fire will
cook a very large fish in a short time. An old canoe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
paddle may be used for this purpose. The food is hung
on nails driven in the board, a strip of bacon, hung
above the fish and dripping on it would improve the
flavor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i054.png" width="250" height="201" alt="THE FOLDING BAKER" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE FOLDING BAKER</span>
</div>

<p>It is a good plan to use a separate frying board when
cooking fish, as the juice from the fish seeps into the
board and it is practically impossible to remove it by
cleaning. The flavor of fish is not pleasant on other
food. If it is not practicable to carry two frying boards
one can be careful to reserve the same side of one
board for cooking fish.</p>

<p>A long cooking spoon for dishing vegetables out of
the pots is very useful. A roll of paper towels for drying
dishes and for use as napkins, or cloth dish towels
and paper napkins are also useful. Other useful articles
are a dish mop with a wooden handle, and a pancake
turner.</p>

<p><i>The Folding Baker</i>&mdash;The baker may be placed before
the blazing fire. It is a perfect arrangement for baking
biscuits and roasting meats.</p>

<p><i>Friction Top Cans</i>&mdash;It is well to have these varying
in capacity from one to three quarts. Use one
quart size for washing soda, powdered soap, and sugar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
The larger sizes should carry flour, cornmeal, etc.
Eggs may be placed in the one used for the cornmeal.</p>

<span class="caption">FRICTION TOP CAN</span>
</div>

<p>Where convenient to provide a large equipment the
following utensils are suggested:</p>

<p>Camp grate, 3 wire toasters (one for meat, one for
fish, one for bread), 2 frying boards (one for meat,
one for fish), 6-quart pail for reserve water, 9-quart
pail for boiling vegetables, agate or paper plates, agate
or paper cups, knives, forks, spoons, kit knife, paper
towels, dish mops, powdered soap, cotton gloves for
handling hot or smoky pots, candles, matches (in waterproof
packages), non-rusting wire 1/8 inch thick for hanging
pots, etc.</p>

<p>A large permanent camp may add greatly to the pleasure
of its members, and make a delightful break in the
day, by sending off troops of, say, eight girls to cook
a camp lunch at a place about a mile distant. For this
purpose, when a group plans to do a great deal of camping
the above equipment is suggested. It could all be
packed in the pack basket, and the girls could take turns
carrying it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">FOLDING FRYING PAN</span>
</div>

<p>Such a basket without a canvas cover costs about $8
and is extremely useful in permanent camp equipment.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Utensils Required for a Party of Eight and their Uses</b></div>

<p>If the group of girls plans for a camping trip of
several days and transport is available, all the following
utensils will be found useful. These may be purchased
in any sporting goods store.</p>

<p><i>Three Wire Toasters</i>&mdash;One for meat, one for fish, one
for toast.</p>

<p>In cooking meat or fish, and in making toast before
a blazing fire, stand the wire toaster upright before the
fire and prop it up with a stick.</p>

<p>A board may be used in the same manner. It is
often desirable to do this in order to avoid the delay of
waiting for the fire to burn down.</p>

<p><i>Cooking Pots</i>&mdash;Size 5 quarts, for boiling vegetables;
size 6-1/2 quarts, for boiling vegetables; size 9 quarts,
for hot water; size 15 quarts, for reserve cold water.</p>

<p>Each of these pots nests in the next larger size, making
one package. A cocoa pot of this type nests into the
5-quart pail.</p>

<p><i>Two Frying Pans</i>&mdash;The handles fold in and the pans
pack in a case with the nest of cooking pots. In addition
to their usual uses, the frying pans are also used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
as dish-washing pans, one for the washing and one for
the rinsing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i057.png" width="450" height="249" alt="COMPLETE COOKING OUTFIT FOR EIGHT SCOUTS" title="" />
<span class="caption">COMPLETE COOKING OUTFIT FOR EIGHT SCOUTS</span>
</div>

<p>A heaped teaspoon of washing soda dissolved in hot
water will so perfectly clean the frying pans as to
permit their use as dish-pans.</p>

<p>Eight agate plates, or aluminum if possible; eight
agate cups, or aluminum if possible; eight knives, forks
and spoons; one large, long-handled cooking spoon.</p>

<p>The complete cooking outfit may be nested together
and packed in a canvas bag and takes up about as much
space as a water pail.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Provisions</b></div>

<p>"When a party camps where fresh meat and farm
products can be procured as they are wanted, its provisioning
is chiefly a matter of taste, and calls for no
special comment here. But to have good meals in the
wilderness is a different matter. A man will eat five
or six pounds a day of fresh food. That is a heavy
load on the trail. And fresh meat, dairy products, fruit
and vegetables are generally <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'to'">too</ins> bulky, too perishable.
So it is up to the woodsman to learn how to get the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
most nourishment out of the least weight and bulk in
materials that 'keep' well.</p>

<p>"Light outfitting, as regards food, is mainly a question
of <i>how much water</i> we are willing to carry in our
rations. For instance, canned peaches are 88 per cent.
water. Can one afford to carry so much water from
home when there is plenty of it at camp?</p>

<p>"The following table is suggestive:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Water table">

</table></div>

<p>"Although this table is good in its way, it is not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
fair measure of the relative value of foods. Even the
solid part of some foodstuffs contains a good deal of
refuse (potatoes 20 per cent), while others have none.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/i058.png" width="236" height="300" alt="FIVE QUART PAIL TO NEST CANS" title="" />
<span class="caption">FIVE QUART PAIL TO NEST CANS</span>
</div>

<p>"<i>Nutritive Values</i>&mdash;The nutritive elements of foodstuffs
are protein, a little mineral matter, fats, and carbohydrates.
Protein is the basis of muscles, bone, tendon,
cartilage, skin and corpuscles of the blood. Fats
and carbohydrates supply heat and muscular energy.
In other words, the human body is an engine; protein
keeps it in repair; fats and carbohydrates are the fuel
to run it.</p>

<p>"Familiar examples of proteids are lean meat and
white of egg. The chief food fats are fat meat, butter,
lard, oil and cream. Carbohydrates are starchy foods
(flour, cereals, etc.) and sugar (sweets of almost any
kind).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>"The problem of a well-balanced ration consists in
supplying daily the right proportion of nutritive elements
in agreeable and digestible form. The problem
of a campaign ration is the same, but cutting out most
of the water and waste in which fresh foods abound.
However, in getting rid of the water in fresh meats,
fruits and vegetables we lose, unfortunately, much of
the volatile essences that give these foods their good
flavor. This loss&mdash;and it is a serious one&mdash;must be
made up by the camp cook, changing the menu as often
as he can by varying the ingredients and the processes
of cooking.</p>

<p>"<i>Variety</i> is quite as welcome at the camp board as
anywhere else, in fact, more so; for it is harder to get.
Variety need not mean adding to the load. It means
<i>substituting</i>, say, three 5-pound parcels for one 15-pound
parcel, so as to have something 'different' from
day to day.</p>

<p>"<i>Digestibility</i>&mdash;We must bear in mind the adage
that 'we live not upon what we eat but upon what
we digest.' Some foods rich in protein, especially
beans, peas, and oatmeal, are not easily assimilated,
unless cooked for a longer time than campers
generally can spare. A considerable part of their protein
is liable to putrefy in the alimentary canal, and so
be worse than wasted. An excess of meat or fish will
do the same thing. Other foods of very high theoretical
value are constipating if used in large amounts, as
cheese, nuts, chocolate.</p>

<p>"<i>Food Components</i>&mdash;Let us now consider the material
of field rations, item by item.</p>

<p>"<i>Bacon</i>&mdash;Good old breakfast bacon worthily heads
the list, for it is the campaigner's standby. It keeps
well in any climate, and demands no special care in
packing. It is easy to cook, combines well with almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
anything, is handier than lard to fry things with, does
just as well to shorten bread or biscuits, is very nutritious,
and nearly everybody likes it. Take it with you
from home, for you can seldom buy it away from railroad
towns. Get the boneless, in 5 to 8 pound flitches.
Let canned bacon alone; it lacks flavor and costs more
than it is worth. A little mould on the outside of a
flitch does no harm, but reject bacon that is soft and
watery, or with yellow fat, or with brownish or black
spots in the lean.</p>

<p>"<i>Smoked Ham</i>&mdash;Small ones generally are tough and
too salty. Hard to keep in warm or damp weather;
moulds easily. Is attractive to blow-flies, which quickly
fill it with 'skippers' if they can get at it. If kept in a
cheesecloth bag and hung in a cool, airy place a ham
will last until eaten up and will be relished. Ham will
keep, even in warm weather, if packed in a stout paper
bag so as to exclude flies. It will keep indefinitely if
sliced, boiled or fried and put up in tins with melted
lard poured over it to keep out air. * * *</p>

<p>"<i>Canned Soups</i>&mdash;These are wholesome enough, but
their fluid kinds are very bulky for their meager nutritive
value. However, a few cans of consomme are fine
for 'stock' in camp soups or stews, and invaluable in
case of sickness. Here, as in canned meat, avoid the
country grocery kind.</p>

<p>"<i>Condensed Soups</i>&mdash;Soup powders are a great help
in time of trouble&mdash;but don't rely on them for a full
meal. There are some that are complete in themselves
and require nothing but 15 to 20 minutes' cooking;
others take longer, and demand (in small type on the
label) the addition of ingredients that generally you
haven't got. Try various brands at home till you find
what you like.</p>

<p>"<i>Cured Fish</i>&mdash;Shredded codfish and smoked halibut,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
sprats, boneless herring are portable and keep well. They
will be relished for variety's sake.</p>

<p>"<i>Eggs</i>&mdash;To vary the camp bill of fare, eggs are simply
invaluable, not only by themselves, but as ingredients
in cooking. * * *</p>

<p>"When means of transportation permit, fresh eggs
may be carried to advantage. A hand crate holding 12
dozen weighs about 24 pounds, filled.</p>

<p>"Eggs can be packed along in winter without danger
of breakage by carrying them frozen. Do not try to
boil a frozen egg; <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'peal'">peel</ins> it as you would a hard-boiled one
and then fry or poach.</p>

<p>"To test an egg for freshness, drop it into cold water;
if it sinks quickly it is fresh; if it stands on end it is
doubtful; if it floats it is surely bad.</p>

<p>"To preserve eggs, rub them all over with vaseline,
being careful that no particle of shell is uncoated. They
will keep good much longer than if treated with lime
water, salt, paraffine, water-glass or any of the other
common expedients.</p>

<p>"On hard trips it is impracticable to carry eggs in
the shell. Some campers break fresh eggs and pack
them in friction-top cans. The yolks soon break and
they keep but a short time. <i>A good brand</i> of desiccated
eggs is the solution of this problem. It does away
with all risk of breaking and spoiling and reduces bulk
very much. Desiccated eggs vary a great deal in quality,
according to material and process employed. Desiccated
eggs made of the yolks are merely useful as ingredients
in cooking.</p>

<p>"<i>Milk</i>&mdash;Sweetened condensed milk (the 'salve of the
lumberjacks') is distasteful to most people. Plain evaporated
milk is the thing to carry&mdash;and don't leave it
out if you can practicably tote it. The notion that this
is a 'baby food' to be scorned by real woodsmen is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
nothing but a foolish conceit. Few things pay better
for their transportation. It will be allowed that Admiral
Peary knows something about food values. Here is
what he says in <i>The North Pole</i>: 'The essentials, and
the only essentials, needed in a serious Arctic sledge
journey, no matter what the season, the temperature,
or the duration of the journey&mdash;whether one month or
six&mdash;are four: pemmican, tea, ship's biscuit, condensed
milk. The standard daily ration for work on the final
sledge journey toward the Pole on all expeditions has
been as follows: 1 lb. pemmican, 1 lb. ship's biscuit, 4 oz.
condensed milk, 1/2 oz. compressed tea.'</p>

<p>"Milk, either evaporated or powdered, is a very important
ingredient in camp cookery.</p>

<p>"<i>Butter</i>&mdash;This is another 'soft' thing that pays its
freight.</p>

<p>"For ordinary trips it suffices to pack butter firmly
into pry-up tin cans which have been sterilized by thorough
scalding and then cooled in a perfectly clean place.
Keep it in a spring or in cold running water (hung in a
net, or weighted in a rock) whenever you can. When
traveling, wrap the cold can in a towel or other insulating
material.</p>

<p>"If I had to cut out either lard or butter I would
keep the butter. It serves all the purposes of lard in
cooking, is wholesomer, and beyond that, it is the most
concentrated source of energy that one can use with
impunity.</p>

<p>"<i>Cheese</i>&mdash;Cheese has nearly twice the fuel value of
a porterhouse steak of equal weight, and it contains a
fourth more protein. It is popularly supposed to be
hard to digest, but in reality it is not so if used in moderation.
The best kind for campers is potted cheese, or
cream or 'snappy' cheese put up in tinfoil. If not so
protected from air it soon dries out and grows stale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
A tin of imported Camembert will be a pleasant surprise
on some occasion.</p>

<p>"<i>Bread Biscuits</i>&mdash;It is well to carry enough yeast
bread for two or three days, until the game country is
reached and camp routine is established. To keep it
fresh, each loaf must be sealed in wax paper or
parchment paper (the latter is best, because it is tough,
waterproof, greaseproof). Bread freezes easily; for
cold weather luncheons carry toasted bread.</p>

<p>"<i>Hardtack</i> (pilot bread, ship biscuit) can be recommended
only for such trips or cruises as do not permit
baking. It is a cracker prepared of plain flour and
water, not even salted, and kiln-dried to a chip, so as to
keep indefinitely, its only enemies being weevils. Get
the coarsest grade. To make hardtack palatable toast
it until crisp, or soak in hot coffee and butter it, or at
least salt it.</p>

<p>"Swedish hardtack, made of whole rye flour, is good
for a change.</p>

<p>"Plasmon biscuit, imported from England, is the most
nutritious breadstuff I have ever used. It is a round
cracker, firm but not hard, of good flavor, containing
a large percentage of the protein of milk, six of the
small biscuits holding as much proteid as a quarter of
a pound of beef.</p>

<p>"<i>Flour</i>&mdash;Graham and entire wheat flours contain more
protein than patent flour, but this is offset by the fact
that it is not so digestible as the protein of standard
flour. Practically there is little or no difference between
them in the amount of protein assimilated. The
same seems to be true of their mineral ingredients.</p>

<p>"Many campers depend a good deal on self-raising
flour because it saves a little trouble in mixing. But
such flour is easily spoiled by dampness, it does not
make as good biscuits or flapjacks as one can turn out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
in camp by doing his own mixing, and it will not do
for thickening, dredging, etc.</p>

<p>"Flour and meal should be sifted before starting on an
expedition. There will be no sieve in camp."</p>

<p>"<i>Baking Powder</i>&mdash;Get the best available powder, put
up in air and damp-eight tins, so that your material will
be in good condition when you come to use it in camp.
Baking soda will not be needed on short trips, but is
required for longer ones, in making sour-dough, as a
steady diet of baking-powder bread or biscuit will ruin
the stomach if persisted in for a considerable time. Soda
also is useful medicinally.</p>

<p>"<i>Cornmeal</i>&mdash;Some like yellow, some prefer white. The
flavor of freshly ground meal is best, but the ordinary
granulated meal of commerce keeps better, because it
has been kiln-dried. Cornmeal should not be used as
the leading breadstuff, for reasons already given, but
johnnycake, corn pancakes, and mush are a welcome
change from hot wheat bread or biscuit, and the average
novice at cooking may succeed better with them.
The meal is useful to roll fish in before frying.</p>

<p>"<i>Breakfast Cereals</i>&mdash;These according to taste, and for
variety's sake. Plain cereals, particularly oatmeal, require
a long cooking, either in a double boiler or with
constant stirring, to make them digestible; and then there
is a messy pot to clean up. They do more harm than
good to campers who hurry their cooking. So it is best
to buy the partially cooked cereals that take only a few
minutes to prepare. Otherwise the 'patent breakfast
foods' have no more nutritive quality than plain grain;
some of them not so much. The notion that bran has
remarkable food value is a delusion; it actually makes
the protein of the grain less digestible. As for mineral
matter, 'to build up bone and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'eth'">teeth</ins> and brawn,' there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
is enough of it in almost any mixed diet, without swallowing
a lot of crude fiber.</p>

<p>"Rice, although not very appetizing by itself, combines
so well in stew or the like, and goes so well in
pudding, that it deserves a place in the commissariat.</p>

<p>"<i>Macaroni</i>&mdash;The various pastes (pas-tay, as the Italians
call them) take the place of bread, may be cooked in
many ways to lend variety, and are especially good in
soups which otherwise would have little nourishing power.
Spaghetti, vermicelli, and noodles all are good in
their way. Break macaroni into inch pieces and pack
so that insects cannot get into it. It is more wholesome
than flapjacks and it 'sticks to the ribs.'</p>

<p>"<i>Sweets</i>&mdash;Sugar is stored-up energy, and is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'assimiated'">assimilated</ins>
more quickly than any other food. Men in the
open soon get to craving sweets.</p>

<p>"Maple sugar is always welcome. Get the soft kind
that can be spread on bread for luncheons. Syrup is
easily made from it in camp by simply bringing it to a
boil with the necessary amount of water. Ready-made
syrup is mean to pack around.</p>

<p>"Sweet chocolate (not too sweet) has remarkable sustaining
power.</p>

<p>"When practicable, take along some jam and marmalade.
The commissaries of the British Army were
wise when they gave jam an honorable place in Tommy
Atkins' field ration. Yes: jam for soldiers in time of
war. So many ounces of it, substituted, mind you, for
so many ounces of the porky, porky, porky, that has
ne'er a streak of lean. So, a little current jelly with
your duck or venison is worth breaking all rules for.
Such conserves can be repacked by the buyer in pry-up
cans that have been sterilized as recommended under
the heading <i>Butter</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Fresh Vegetables</i>&mdash;The only ones worth taking along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
are potatoes and onions. Choose potatoes with small
eyes and of uniform medium size, even if you have to
buy half a bushel to sort out a peck. They are very
heavy and bulky in proportion to their food value; so
you cannot afford to be burdened with any but the best.
Cereals and beans take the place of potatoes when you
go light.</p>

<p>"Fresh onions are almost indispensable for seasoning
soups, stews, etc. A few of them can be taken along
almost anywhere. I generally carry at least one, even
on a walking trip. Onions are good for the suddenly
overtaxed system, relieve the inordinate thirst that one
experiences the first day or two, and assist excretion.
Freezing does not spoil onions if they are kept frozen
until used.</p>

<p>"<i>Beans</i>&mdash;A prime factor in cold weather camping.
Take a long time to cook ('soak all day and cook all
night' is the rule). Cannot be cooked done at altitudes
of 5,000 feet and upward. Large varieties cook quickest,
but the small white navy beans are best for baking.
Pick them over before packing, as there is much waste.</p>

<p>"<i>Split Peas</i>&mdash;Used chiefly in making a thick, nourishing
soup.</p>

<p>"<i>Dehydrated Vegetables</i>&mdash;Much of the flavor of fresh
vegetables is lost when the juice is expressed or evaporated,
but all of their nutriment is retained and enough
of the flavor for them to serve as fair substitutes when
fresh vegetables cannot be carried. They help out a
camp stew and may even be served as side dishes if one
has butter and milk to season them. Generally they require
soaking (which can be done over night); then they
are to be boiled slowly until tender, taking about as
much time as fresh vegetables. If cooking is hurried
they will be woody and tasteless.</p>

<p>"Dehydrated vegetables are very portable, keep in any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
climate, and it is well to carry some on trips far from
civilization.</p>

<p>"<i>Canned Vegetables</i>&mdash;In our table of food values it
will be noticed that the least nourishing article for its
weight and bulk is a can of tomatoes. Yet these 'air-tights'
are great favorites with outdoors men, especially
in the West and South, where frequently they are eaten
raw out of the can. It is not so much their flavor as
their acid that is grateful to a stomach overtaxed with
fat or canned meat and hot bread three times a day.
If wanted only as an adjuvant to soups, stews, rice,
macaroni, etc., the more concentrated puree will serve
very well.</p>

<p>"Canned corn (better still, 'kornlet,' which is concentrated
milk of sweet corn) is quite nourishing, and
everybody likes it.</p>

<p>"A few cans of baked beans (<i>without</i> tomato sauce)
will be handy in wet weather. The B. &amp; M. 3/4 lb. cans
are convenient for a lone camper or for two going light.</p>

<p>"<i>Nuts</i>&mdash;A handful each of shelled nuts and raisins,
with a cake of sweet chocolate, will carry a man far
on the trail or when he has lost it. The kernels of butternuts
and hickory nuts have the highest fuel value of
our native species; peanuts and almonds are very rich
in protein; Brazil nuts, filberts and pecans, in fat. Peanut
butter is a concentrated food that goes well in sandwiches.
One can easily make nut butter of any kind
(except almonds or Brazil nuts) for himself by using
the nut grinder that comes with a kitchen food chopper,
and can add ground dates, ground popcorn, or whatever
he likes; but such preparations will soon grow rancid
if not sealed airtight. Nut butter is more digestible than
kernels unless the latter are thoroughly chewed.</p>

<p>"<i>Fruits</i>&mdash;All fruits are very deficient in protein and
(except olives) in fat, but dried fruit is rich in carbo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>hydrates.
Fruit acid (that of prunes, dried apricots,
and dehydrated cranberries, when fresh fruit cannot be
carried) is a good corrective of a too fatty and starchy
or sugary diet, and a preventive of scurvy. Most fruits
are laxative, and for that reason, if none other, a good
proportion of dried fruit should be included in the
ration, no matter how light one travels; otherwise one
is likely to suffer from constipation when he changes
from 'town grub' to 'trail grub.'</p>

<p>"Among canned fruits those that go farthest are pineapples
and blackberries. Excellent jelly can be made
in camp from dried apples.</p>

<p>"There is much nourishment in dates, figs (those dried
round are better than layer figs) and raisins. Pitted
dates and seedless raisins are best for light outfits. And
do not despise the humble prune; buy the best grade in
the market (unknown to landladies) and soak over night
before stewing; it will be a revelation. Take a variety
of dried fruits, and mix them in different combinations,
sweet and tart, so as not to have the same sauce twice
in succession; then you will learn that dried fruits are
by no means a poor substitute for fresh or canned ones.</p>

<p>"In hot weather I carry a few lemons whenever practicable.
Limes are more compact and better medicinally,
but they do not keep well. Lime juice in bottles is excellent,
if you carry it.</p>

<p>"Citric acid crystals may be used in lieu of lemons
when going light, but the flavor is not so good as that
of lemonade powder that one can put up for himself.
The process is described by A. W. Barnard: 'Squeeze
out the lemons and sift into the clear juice four to six
spoonfuls of sugar to a lemon; let stand a few days if
the weather is dry, or a week if wet, till it is dried up,
then pulverize and put up into capsules.' Gelatin capsules
of any size, from one oz. down, can be procured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
at a drug store. They are convenient to carry small
quantities of spices, flavoring, medicines, etc., on a hike.</p>

<p>"Vinegar and pickles are suitable only for fixed camps
or easy cruises.</p>

<p>"<i>Fritures</i>&mdash;Lard is less wholesome than olive oil, or
'Crisco,' or the other preparations of vegetable fats.
Crisco can be heated to a higher temperature than lard
without burning, thus ensuring the 'surprise' which prevents
getting a fried article sodden with grease;
it does as well as lard for shortening; and it can be used
repeatedly without transmitting the flavor of one dish to
the next one. Olive oil is superior as a friture, especially
for fish, but expensive.</p>

<p>"<i>Beverages</i>&mdash;Tea is better than coffee. Even if
you don't use it at home, take along on your camping
trip enough for midday meals. Tea tabloids are not
bad, but I advise using the real thing. On a hike, with
no tea-ball, I tie up enough for each pint in a bit of
washed cheesecloth, loosely, leaving enough string attached
whereby to whisk it out after exactly four minutes'
steeping.</p>

<p>"Cocoa is not only a drink but a food. It is best for
the evening meal because it makes one sleepy, whereas
tea and coffee have the opposite effect.</p>

<p>"Get the soluble kind if you want it quickly prepared.</p>

<p>"<i>Condiments</i>&mdash;Do not leave out a small assortment of
condiments wherewith to vary the taste of common articles
and serve a new sauce or gravy or pudding now
and then.</p>

<p>"Salt is best carried in a wooden box. The amount
used in cooking and at table is small.</p>

<p>"White pepper is better than black. Some Cayenne
or Chili should also be taken. Red pepper is not only
a good stomachic, but also is fine for a chili (made into
a tea with hot water and sugar).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>"Among condiments I class beef extract, bouillon
cubes or capsules, and the like. They are of no use as
food except to stimulate a feeble stomach or furnish a
spurt of energy, but invaluable for flavoring camp-made
soups and stews when you are far away from beef.
The powder called Oystero yields an oyster flavor.</p>

<p>"Mustard is useful not only at table but for medicinal
purposes; cloves, not only for its more obvious purposes,
but to stick in an onion for a stew, and perchance
for a toothache.</p>

<p>"Celery and parsley can now be had in dehydrated
form. Some sage may be needed for stuffing." Onion
and celery salt are real additions to the camp cooking
outfit.</p>

<p>"If you aim at cake-making and puddings, ginger
and cinnamon may be required. Curry powder is relished
by many; its harshness may be tempered with sweet fruits
or sugar.</p>

<p>"On short trips, salt and pepper will meet all requirements.<br /><br /></p>

<p>"<i>Packing Food</i>&mdash;Meat of any kind will quickly mould
or spoil if packed in tins from which air is not exhausted.</p>

<p>"Flour should not be carried in the original sacks; they
wet through or absorb moisture from the air, snag easily,
and burst under the strain of a lashrope. Pack your
flour, cereals, vegetables, dried fruits, etc., in the round-bottomed
paraffined bags sold by outfitters (various sizes,
from 10 lbs. down), which are damp-proof and have the
further merit of standing up on their bottoms instead of
always falling over. Put a tag on each bag and label
it in <i>ink</i>. These small bags may then be stowed in 9-inch
waterproof canvas provision bags (see outfitter's catalogues),
but in that case the thing you want is generally
at the bottom. * * *</p>

<p>"Butter, lard, ground coffee, tea, sugar, jam, matches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
go in pry-up tin cans, sold by outfitters (small quantities
in mailing tubes), or in common capped tins with
tops secured by surgeon's plaster. Get pepper and spices
in shaker-top cans, or, if you carry common shakers,
cover tops with cloth and snap stout rubber bands around
them.</p>

<p>"Often it is well to carry separately enough food to
last the party between the jumping-off place and the
main camp site, as it saves the bother of breaking bulk
en route.</p>

<p>"When transportation is easy it pays to pack the bread,
bags of flour, etc., in a tin wash-boiler or two, which are
wrapped in burlaps and crated. These make capital grub
boxes in camp, securing their contents from wet, insects
and rodents. Ants in summer and mice at all times
are downright pests of the woods, to say nothing of the
wily coon, the predatory mink, the inquisitive skunk, and
the fretful porcupine. The boilers are useful, too, on
many occasions to catch rain-water, boil clothes, waterproof
and dye tents, and so forth.</p>

<p>"<i>A Last Look Around</i>&mdash;Check off every article in the
outfit as it is stowed, and keep the inventory for future
reference. Then note what is left over at the end of the
trip. This will help in outfitting for the next season."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Camp Cooking</b></div>

<p>Meat and fish are easy to cook and require few utensils.
Steaks or chops require from four to twelve minutes to
broil rare over a good bed of live coals, depending on
the thickness of the meat. Place either directly on the
coals in wire broiler and raise only an inch or two above
the fire. Turn after about 1-1/2 minutes, and afterward
turn a little oftener to prevent burning.</p>

<p>Chicken or duck of broiling size takes about 20 minutes
to broil and requires very particular care in frequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
turning to prevent burning. Turn about every 1/2 minute.
As portions of the skin show signs of getting too
brown baste them with a few drops of hot water from a
large spoon. This also tends to keep them moist. The
poultry may be cooked by propping the wire broiler upright
six to nine inches from a blazing fire. Often
the poultry is started this way and finished over the
coals, as this saves considerable time in waiting for the
fire to burn down. The chicken or duck may be hung
close to the fire by a wire from a slanting pole, revolving
frequently. An hour is required to roast poultry.</p>

<p><i>Stew</i>&mdash;Cut meat in small pieces, brown in frying pan
(use drippings), remove and place in stew pan in which
there is sufficient water to cover stew. Cut vegetables
in small pieces, place in frying pan a few minutes&mdash;long
enough to soften&mdash;place in stew pan, season with salt
and pepper, cook one-half hour&mdash;add flour thickening
(water and flour), cover with enough water to prevent
stew becoming dry and bury in hot oven for two or
three hours.</p>

<p><i>Broiled Fish</i>&mdash;Place in wire broiler, rubbing broiler
first with salt pork or lard to prevent sticking, and broil
over coals for about 20 minutes. All fish that is broiled
should be served with a little butter sauce.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Frying Pan Dishes</b></div>

<p><i>Fried Fish</i>&mdash;Cut the fish in pieces; that is, serving
portions. Roll fish in cornmeal (this is not absolutely
necessary). Fry for about 20 minutes (depending upon
thickness of fish) over hot fire, in about 2 tablespoons
of heated frying oil. Tried-out bacon, salt pork, lard,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'crisco'">Crisco</ins>, or prepared cooking oil may be used.</p>

<p><i>Fish Balls</i>&mdash;Fish balls prepared at home and carried
along make good camp food. For group of eight: Ingredients&mdash;1
bowl dried codfish soaked several hours in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
cold water, 1 egg, 2 raw potatoes cut in pieces, 2 ozs.
butter, frying oil, 2 tablespoons milk. Boil codfish and
potatoes together for about 10 minutes, mash, add 1
beaten egg, butter size of 1/2 small egg (about 2 ozs.), 2
tablespoons milk and stir thoroughly. This mixture
should be about the consistency of stiff oatmeal. Heat
small amount of frying oil in pan. Drop batter from
large spoon into hot oil. When brown, turn and cook
on other side. Each patty should cook about three minutes
to the side, about six minutes for the whole.</p>

<p><i>Fried Ham</i>&mdash;Boil in frying pan for about 5 minutes,
then pour off water and fry about two minutes on each
side.</p>

<p><i>Fried Bacon</i>&mdash;Fry gently until fat is tried out (Save
drippings.) Bacon may also be fried on a hot rock, or
cooked on sharp pointed stick with forked ends.</p>

<p><i>Fried Country Sausage</i>&mdash;Fry sausages over moderate
fire for about 15 minutes till they are brown.</p>

<p><i>Corn Beef Hash</i>&mdash;Carry with the ingredients already
prepared 1 part corned beef, chopped, 2 parts chopped
cold boiled potatoes. Melt butter or suet into the frying
pan. Fry.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Vegetables</b></div>

<p><i>Boiled Potatoes</i>&mdash;Clean and scrape potatoes. Do not
peel. Have water boiling and salted before putting potatoes
in pot and keep water boiling until potatoes are
soft. Large ones take about 25 minutes to cook. Plan
to serve the meal about 25 minutes after the potatoes
are put on the fire, for they are best served hot. When
potatoes are cooked, drain water and keep hot until
served.</p>

<p><i>Fried Potatoes</i>&mdash;Slice cold boiled potatoes uniformly
and fry in hot butter until brown.</p>

<p><i>Fried Raw Potatoes</i>&mdash;Slice raw potatoes uniformly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
boil in frying pan 5 minutes and then fry in butter until
brown.</p>

<p><i>Onions</i>&mdash;Boil in salted water 30 minutes until tender.
Onions and potatoes go well together and campers should
boil them together.</p>

<p><i>Green Peas</i>&mdash;Buy them fresh from a farmer near camp
if possible. Reject over-ripe pods. Shell and boil about
20 minutes in salted water, keeping peas barely covered.
Drain almost all water when cooked and add one ounce
of butter.</p>

<p><i>Green Corn</i>&mdash;Boil corn about five minutes in boiling
salted water.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Cocoa</b></div>

<p>One teaspoonful (level) to each person, 1/2 cup of
water to each person, 1/2 cup of milk to each person.
Cook cocoa in water 5 minutes; add to warm milk and
allow it to reach boiling point. <i>Do not boil.</i></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Bread</b></div>

<p>When possible carry along a supply of bread.</p>

<p><i>Toast</i>&mdash;Toast may either be made over coals or by
propping wire broiler upright before blazing fire.</p>

<p>"<i>Biscuit Loaf</i>&mdash;This is a standard camp bread, because
it bakes quickly. It is good so long as it is hot, but it
dries out soon and will not keep. For four: 3 pints
flour, 3 heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder, 1 heaping
teaspoonful salt, 2 heaping tablespoonfuls cold grease,
1 scant pint cold water. Amount of water varies according
to quality of flour. Baking powders vary in
strength; follow directions on can. Mix thoroughly, with
big spoon or wooden paddle, first the baking powder with
the flour and then the salt. Rub into this the cold grease
(which may be lard, cold pork fat, drippings) until there
are no lumps left and no grease adhering to bottom of
pan. This is a little tedious, but don't shirk it. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
stir in the water and work it with spoon until you have
a rather stiff dough. Have the pan greased. Turn the
loaf into it and bake. Test center of loaf with a sliver
when you think it properly done. When no dough adheres
remove bread. All hot breads should be broken
with the hand, never cut.</p>

<p>"To freshen any that is left over and dried out, sprinkle
a little water over it and heat through. This can be done
but once."</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Washing Dishes</b></div>

<p>Every part of the camp work should be a pleasure,
and there is no reason whatever that dish washing should
be an exception. If the following directions for dish
washing are followed the work may be so quickly and
perfectly done as to be part of the fun.</p>

<p>1. Each girl should throw scraps from her plate into
a trench or receptacle. Do not throw food scraps on
the camp fire, as they make a disagreeable smoke.</p>

<p>2. Wipe each plate and other utensils as clean as possible
with paper napkin, and throw napkin in the fire.</p>

<p>3. Scrape out all cooking pots. If any material has
burned on them, boil them out with one ounce of washing
soda to one quart of water.</p>

<p>4. Pile all dishes thus prepared beside the two dish-pans.
Partly fill the dish-pans with boiling water, putting
a heaping teaspoonful of powdered soap in one.</p>

<p>5. Wash dishes with dish mop, and rinse in other pan
of hot water.</p>

<p>If the water is kept hot one girl can keep two busy
drying, and the whole operation for a party of four
should not take over ten minutes. If unskillfully done,
without sufficient hot water or preparation, it is a disagreeable
task. Try to make it a pleasant one.</p>

<p>The coffee pot should be frequently boiled out with
washing soda.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>The wire broilers may be cleaned by rubbing them
with ashes from the camp fire.</p>

<p>In nesting a blackened cooking pail, wrap it in paper
to prevent soiling the inside of the pail into which it fits.</p>

<p>Use the fewest dishes possible in cooking and you will
lighten your labor.</p>

<p>Use the same plates for different courses, rinsing them
with hot water.</p>

<p>Be sure to carry in your dish washing outfit, washing
soda, powdered soap and dish mops.</p>

<p>"Dutch Cleanser" is very useful in cleaning dishes,
pots and pans.</p>

<p>After washing up for the night, put utensils and provision
box together and cover with rubber cloth to protect
them from the weather.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Cleaning Up</b></div>

<p><i>This is important!</i> If you leave your camping place
littered with tin cans, paper, etc., you will be spoiling
that place for future campers.</p>

<p>Burn all waste paper and string.</p>

<p>Bury tin cans and empty bottles.</p>

<p>Bury food scraps and refuse.</p>

<p><i>Be absolutely certain that you have extinguished your
fire.</i></p>

<p>You should take pride in leaving your camp site so
clean that not one evidence of your camping remains
except the ashes of the fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<h3><br />MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</h3>

<div class='center'>BY ELOISE ROORBACH, GARDEN EDITOR OF "TOUCHSTONE."</div>

<p>Mountain climbing is the final test of a Girl Scout's
perseverance in following a trail, in endurance, courage
and woodcraftmanship. Nature reserves her choicest
beauties and secrets for those who know how to conquer
all difficulties. No Girl Scout's education is complete
until she has seen mountain peaks like waves of the sea
flashing with white snow foam, piercing the blue sky
as far as the eye can reach; clouds forming below her
feet; breathed rare air found only in high places; drunk
from the pure source of rivers, and heard the mighty
roar of waterfalls. A climb to a high mountain top is
an experience that will enrich and influence the entire
after life of whoever has had the hardihood and wisdom
to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Before attempting this last test of scouting the girl
must be in perfect physical trim, be able to sleep on the
ground, have learned to live simply. Girls should train
for this experience by taking graduated hikes. On these
hikes the girls can practice using the condensed foods
that must be depended upon in mountain climbing. The
rations for those who wish to climb to high places must
necessarily be condensed, for each Scout must carry her
own rations for two weeks.</p>

<p>The foundation of a mountain climber's bill of fare is
rice, bacon, cheese, chocolate, raisins, dates, dried fruits,
powdered soups, whole wheat crackers, and tea. <i>Tea
should be used instead of coffee.</i> The eating chocolate
is sometimes made into a refreshing drink. Only a small
amount of sugar and salt can be carried. This fare is
augmented by mushrooms, wild fruit and berries and
fish. Watercress is a refreshing addition and a good
Scout knows where to find it. Some hardened climbers
add a little "jerky" (dried meats) to this bill of fare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>No definite rule of distance to be covered in a day
can be laid down. In the high mountains ten or twelve
miles a day should be considered a maximum, for part
of the benefit to be gained from such trips is the enjoyment
of the trip itself. It is better to go a few miles
slowly, observing keenly all the time, stopping for frequent
rests to examine a flower, to drink at a clear
spring, to feast upon the view, than to cover more ground
in a hurried way.</p>

<p>The following is a suggestion for the management of
a day in high mountain altitudes. Arise with the sun or
a little before breakfast. Breakfast consists of rice,
dried fruit (put to soak the night before), bacon, and
shredded wheat biscuit. Before packing, make a small
package of cheese, chocolate, raisins and biscuit for the
noon lunch that can be reached without having to unpack
equipment. There should be a rest of at least an hour
at noon, eating slowly, throwing off the pack, and if
possible relaxing flat on the back for a while. Then another
hike of three or four miles, making camp early in
the evening, about 5 o'clock. This divides the day into
three periods of hikes with a rest in between. The
dinner is like breakfast, with the addition of soup.
Soup can be prepared and eaten while the rice is cooking.
Mountain trout can be fried with bacon.</p>

<p>The equipment must be of the lightest. Clothing
should consist of one pair of stout, high, waterproof,
hob-nailed boots; one pair of light moccasins, to rest the
feet in camp; short skirt; middy; riding breeches or
bloomers (for in crossing difficult passes skirts must be
discarded); hat; gauntlet gloves; one change of underclothes;
three pairs of wool stockings; one sweater; one
comb (no brush); one small pocket mirror; ivory soap
or soap leaves; one tube of cold cream; compass; fishing
rod, lines and hooks; rope; leather thongs; stout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
string; note-book and map; small hatchet; matches (in
waterproof case).</p>

</div>



<p>No guns, books or cameras can be carried on a high
hike, for their weight is prohibitive. A sleeping bag
made of eiderdown, lined with canton flannel and covered
with oiled silk or duck's back can be rolled and carried
across the shoulders. A knife, fork and spoon in
addition to the big sheath knife worn at the belt, one frying
pan, tin plate and cup (aluminum should be used in
preference as tin rusts easily), a rice and a soup kettle
are all the cooking utensils needed. If a company of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Girl Scouts attempts a high mountain climb, additional
covers of clothing and food can be carried on a pack
mule, but this chapter is for those who wish to climb unencumbered
with pack animals. It is by far the finest
way to see the high mountains, though it must be admitted
few have the hardihood or courage to try it.
The new Roosevelt National Park, one of the most magnificent
playgrounds in the world, can be visited in the
way just described.</p>

<p>The writer of this chapter has walked all through this
park carrying the clothing, food and equipment just described.
Every day of the journey found her in better
physical trim, vigor, strength, and with keenness of vision
and joy of life increased daily.</p>

<p>Nature Study means getting acquainted with the multitude
of creatures, great and small, which inhabit the land,
the water, and the air, and with the objects which surround
them. Mother Nature has many, many secrets
which she will reveal to sharp eyes and alert minds. It
is, of course, impossible for any one to learn all these
secrets, but the mastering of a few makes it easier to
learn others, until finally it becomes clear that all life
is related and that the humblest creature may be of the
greatest importance to the welfare of the highest.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons that the <i>Girl Scout</i> should learn
as much as possible of the Wonders of Nature. This
study may begin wherever you are, but rapid progress
will be made by rambles afield and by visits to the great
Natural History Museums. For example, a visit to the
exhibition halls of the American Museum of Natural
History in New York will answer many of your questions
about animals you have seen and will enable you to
answer many others for yourself, when you go out into
the country.</p>

<p>Nature Study in its broadest application includes all of
the natural sciences, such as zoology, botany, geology,
meteorology, and astronomy. So, there are many fascinating
fields for study and enjoyment, and it does not
matter much where we begin, whether it be Wild Flowers,
Trees, Birds, Butterflies, or Stars.</p>

<p>Of the more practical subjects especially suited to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
activities of the Girl Scout are those civic problems which
can only be solved by team-play; that is, by working
together. Among these may be mentioned: The preservation
of birds, wild flowers, and forests; control of
mosquitoes, house-flies, rats, weeds; diseases of plants
and animals, including man.</p>

<p>The civic nature of these problems is appreciated when
we realize that it would do little good, for example, for
one person to destroy the breeding-places of mosquitoes
on his premises, if his neighbors did not do likewise
about their homes; or for one orchardist to cut out the
blight from his pear-trees or the black-knot from his
plum-trees, if his neighbors did not co-operate with him
by ridding their orchards of these diseases.</p>

<p>These <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pratical'">practical</ins> questions are so well presented, together
with plans for their solution, in <i>Civic Biology</i>, by
Clifton F. Hodge and Jean Dawson (Ginn &amp; Co.), that
instead of going into details here, both the <i>Girl Scouts</i>
and their Leaders are referred to this most useful work.</p>

<p>All objects of Nature are either living (organic) or
non-living (inorganic). The non-living bodies include
the minerals and rocks. The living bodies are either
plants or animals. Plants may be divided into two great
groups, the flowerless plants and flowering plants. In
general the flowerless plants reproduce by means of
spores, like the mushroom and the ferns, while the flowering
plants reproduce by means of seeds.</p>

<p>Animals may be separated into two great groups,
those without backbones (invertebrates) like an oyster,
a cricket, or an earthworm, and those with backbones,
e.g., a dog, a fish. In this brief study we shall not go
into much detail about invertebrates, but with the backboned
animals or vertebrates we shall go a little further.
These may be divided into five general groups: (1)
Fishes; (2) Amphibians, which include frogs, toads, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
salamanders; (3) Reptiles, which include alligators,
crocodiles, turtles, lizards, and snakes; (4) Birds; (5)
Mammals.</p>

<p>This simple analysis may be clearly shown by the
following diagram:</p>

<p>This classification could be carried further at every
point, but this will be far enough for present purposes.
It should be remembered in any classification that there
are no hard and fast lines in Nature. For example, some
creatures are on the border-land between plants and animals,
and again some animals are between the backboned
animals and those without backbones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you know the earliest spring flower in your neighborhood?
In the northern United States it is usually
found in bloom before all the snow of winter is gone. In
some swamp or along some stream where the snow has
melted away in patches it is possible to find the Skunk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Cabbage in bloom very early in the spring. See how
early you can find it. In the southern United States, one
of the earliest spring flowers is the yellow Jessamine,
which twines over bushes and trees thus displaying its
fragrant, golden bells.</p>

</div>

<p>As the season advances, other flowers appear, and we
find the Spring Beauty, the Trailing Arbutus, the Bloodroot,
and the Hepatica. What delightful associations
each of these names brings to our minds! By the time
summer is here we have an entirely different flower-population
in the fields and woods&mdash;the Cardinal Flower with
its intense red color and the Pink Lady's-Slipper with its
drooping moccasin-shaped lip are to be found then. In
the autumn we have a different group of flowers still&mdash;the
Goldenrods, the Asters, and the Fringed Gentian, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
season closing with our latest fall flower, the Witch-hazel.</p>

<p>Some flowers and ferns grow best in the shady woods,
others in the sunny fields, some on the rocks and others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
in the marshes. We soon learn where to look for our
favorites. In taking tramps along the roads, across the
fields, through the woods, and into the swamps, we could
notice along the roadside Bouncing-Bet, Common Yarrow,
Dandelion, Thistles, and Goldenrod; in the fields
and meadows, we would see the Ox-eye Daisy, Black-eyed
Susan, Wild Carrot, and the most beautiful fall
flower of the northeastern United States, the Fringed
Gentian; in the woods, Mountain Laurel, Pink Azalea, a
number of wild Orchids, Maidenhair Fern, and Jack-in-the
Pulpit; in the marshes, Pink Rose-mallow, which reminds
us of the Hollyhocks of our Grandmother's garden,
Pickerel-weed, Water-lily, and Marsh Marigold.</p>

<p>It is natural to want to know the name of any plant
that interests us, and this is important. As in the subjects
of Birds, there are many helpful books on Flowers
and Ferns. Beginners will find "The Flower Guide," by
Chester A. Reed (Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.) to be useful.
After a good start has been made, such books as Gray's
<i>Manual</i>, or Britton and Brown's <i>Illustrated Flora</i> should
be used.</p>

<p>Our pursuit, however, should not stop with the name
of a plant. That is a mere beginning. Even slight attention
will uncover many fascinating things in the lives of
plants. Why cannot a farmer raise a good crop of
clover-seed without the bumble-bees? What devices are
there among the Orchids to bring about cross-pollination?
(See "Our Native Orchids," by William Hamilton Gibson).
Examine the flower of the wild Blue Flag, and
see whether you can determine how the bumble-bee cross-pollinates
this plant. Do the Hummingbirds cross-pollinate
some flowers? In what plants is the pollen scattered
by the wind? Do these plants produce nectar?</p>

<p>How do the various plants scatter their seeds? How
are the Hickory-nuts and Walnuts scattered? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Dandelion's and Thistle's seeds have flying-hairs or

other plants can you find whose seeds are scattered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the same way? Can you discover a plant whose seeds
are carried by water? The Witch-hazel shoots its seeds.
What other plants can you find that have explosive
fruits? Cherry-seeds are carried by birds. Mention
some other seeds that are carried in this way. It would
take very little observation to learn how Burdock-burs,
Cockle-burs, Stick-tights, Beggar-lice, Spanish-needles,
and such hooked fruits are scattered.</p>

<p>The trees of the forest are of two classes, deciduous
trees and evergreen trees. To the former belong those
which shed their leaves in the fall, are bare in the winter,
and then grow a new crop of leaves in the spring,
e.g., oaks, elms, maples. The evergreen trees shed their
leaves also, but not all at one time. In fact, they always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
have a goodly number of leaves, and are consequently
green all the year round, e.g., pines, spruces, firs.</p>

<p>The uses of wood are so many and various that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
can only begin to mention them. In looking about us
we see wood used in building houses, in making furniture,
for railroad ties, and for shoring timbers in mines.
In many country districts wood is used for fuel. And
do you realize that only a short time ago the newspaper
which you read this morning and the book which you
now hold in your hand were parts of growing trees in
the forest? Paper is made of wood-pulp, mostly from
Spruce.</p>

</div>

<p>Besides the direct uses of wood, we turn to the forest
for many interesting and valuable products, varying in
importance from a balsam-pillow filled with the fragrant
leaves or needles of the Balsam Fir, to turpentine
and rosin (naval stores), produced chiefly by the Long-leaved
Pine of the Southeastern States. Spruce gum is
obtained from the Black Spruce and Red Spruce. Canada
balsam used in cementing lenses together in micro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>scopes,
telescopes, and the like, comes from the Balsam
Fir. Bark for tanning comes from Oak and Hemlock.
The Indians of the Eastern Woodlands or Great Lakes
area made canoes and many other useful articles of the
bark of the Canoe or Paper Birch. Baskets are made
from Willow twigs. Maple sugar comes chiefly from
the Sugar Maple.</p>

</div>

<p>The turpentine industry is the chief one in parts of
the South where the Long-leaved Pine thrives. The
United States produces more turpentine and rosin than
any other country in the world. The turpentine is used
in paints and in various arts. The rosin is used in varnish,
laundry soap, etc. These two products come from
the sap or "gum" of the pine tree. The sap is secured
by tapping or "boxing" the tree, and then keeping the
cut ducts of the sap-wood open by "chipping" or "pull<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>ing,"
that is, by putting a new "streak" on the tree. This
has to be done once a week from March 1 to November
1. The sap used to be collected in a "box" or deep notch
cut in the base of the tree, but the modern method is to
have it run into cups made of zinc or of burned clay
similar to flower-pots. The sap is taken to a turpentine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
still where it is heated over a furnace. This drives off
the turpentine or "spirits" as steam or vapor, which is
condensed to liquid again by passing through the worm
of the still surrounded by cold water. The rosin or
resin is left behind.</p>

</div>

<p>The Sugar Maple grows from Florida and Texas
northward to Manitoba and Quebec, but it is only in the
northern part of its range that the maple sugar industry
thrives. This delicious food is one of the many that
we learned to utilize from the Indians. The sap is obtained
by tapping the tree in the spring before the leaves
come out, the best weather for the flow of sap being
that when it freezes at night and thaws in the daytime.
The sap is boiled down; that is, the water is driven off
and the sugar remains. It takes about three gallons, or
a little more, of sap to make a pound of maple sugar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
Three to four pounds of sugar is an average yield for
one tree in a season. Much of the sap, however, is not
boiled down into sugar, but the boiling is stopped while
it is in the form of syrup. If you have ever eaten buckwheat
cakes with real maple syrup you will always esteem
the Sugar Maple tree.</p>

<p>The forests perform extremely valuable services for
mankind entirely apart from the products they yield.</p>

<p>First, they prevent erosion, or the washing away of
soil by the water that falls as rain. After the trees have
been cut away, very often, especially upon hillsides, the
most productive soil is washed away, usually clear off of
the original owner's farm, and deposited in the flood-plains
or bottoms of creeks and rivers or in river deltas&mdash;in
places where it cannot be utilized to any great extent.
Thus erosion causes a tremendous loss to farmers,
and it is chiefly due to the thoughtlessness of the American
people in destroying the forests.</p>

<p>Second, and chiefly related to this, is the fact that the
floods upon our rivers, which every year take such heavy
toll in property and in human life, are due to the cutting
away of the forests. This allows the water from rain
and melting snow to reach the streams at times faster
than it can be carried off, and so we have a flood. The
forest floor, with its undergrowth and humus, in those
localities where the forests still exist about the headwaters
of our rivers, acts like a huge layer of blotting
paper which holds the water back and allows it to escape
to the streams slowly, and so floods are avoided.</p>

<p>Third, and related to the above, is the fact that the
water supply of our cities would be more constant if
the forests had not been cut away. In these cases the
summer droughts make much greater the danger from
water-borne diseases.</p>

<p>It is only in recent years that the American people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
have begun to realize the necessity of the conservation
of our forests, and in many sections much has been done
to redeem the criminal thoughtlessness in destroying our
forests and to restore those devastated by forest fires.
Reforestation operations have accomplished a great deal,
and the organization to prevent forest fires emphasizes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
the old adage that "an ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure." Also the people are being taught correct
forestry practices, such as cutting only ripe trees
and allowing the rest to grow, instead of clearing the
land entirely, as was formerly done so universally.</p>

<p>The life history of every tree is interesting; how it
breathes by means of its leaves, just as the animals do
by means of gills or lungs; how it manufactures starch
by means of the green matter in the leaves; how the
starch is changed to sugar and other substances which
are carried to other parts of the tree in the sap; how
the sap flows upward in the vessels in the sap-wood and
downward in the vessels of the inner bark; how the
entire heart-wood of a tree is dead and the only living
part is the sap-wood and the innermost bark.</p>

<p>One of the first things we shall want to know when
we get out into the woods is the name of the tree that
interests us. For this purpose the books given as references
under "Trees" will be useful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>3. ANIMALS</b><br />

<b>Mammals</b></div>

<p>Mammals differ from birds in that they have hair
instead of feathers, and that they are first fed upon
milk produced by the mother. Unfortunately the mammals
are usually called simply <i>animals</i>, but the latter is
obviously too inclusive a term and should not be used
in this way. There is no reason why the name <i>mammal</i>
should not be commonly used, just as <i>birds</i>, <i>reptiles</i>,
<i>amphibians</i>, and <i>fishes</i> are used for the other groups of
backboned animals.</p>

<p>In the United States the lowest or most primitive
mammal is the Opossum. The baby Opossums&mdash;from
six to a dozen of them&mdash;are born when very small and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
undeveloped and are immediately placed by the mother
in an external pouch, where they continue to grow until
they are too large to get into their mother's pocket; then
they frequently ride upon their mother's back, clinging
to her fur with their finger-like toes and wrapping their
tails about their mother's tail. The Opossum is the only
animal in this country the young of which are carried
around in the mother's pocket, and the only one which
has a prehensile tail; that is, one used for coiling around
and clinging to branches, and the like. Its food is various,
consisting of both animal and plant material&mdash;insects,
young birds, pawpaws, persimmons, etc. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
food devoured the Opossum probably does more good
than harm.</p>

<p>In their food habits many mammals are decidedly
injurious. Rats, Weasels, Minks, and Foxes destroy
poultry; Wolves and Pumas kill domestic and game
animals; Woodchucks or Groundhogs eat clover and
various garden plants; Moles damage the lawns; Rats,
Mice, and Gophers spoil and devour grain; Mice and
Rabbits girdle fruit trees, thus killing them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many mammals furnish food;
<i>e. g.</i>, Rabbits, Elk, and Deer. This was more important
in pioneer times than at present. Many furnish furs
used as articles of clothing; <i>e. g.</i>, Raccoon, Fox, Muskrat,
Mink, Otter, Marten, Mole, New York Weasel and
other northern weasels in their winter coats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>A few suggestions for observation or study:</p>

<p>1. What peculiar instinct or habit has the Opossum developed?</p>

<p>2. How does the flight of a Bat differ from that of a
Flying Squirrel?</p>

<p>3. Can you notice any peculiarity in the Rabbit's
track?</p>

<p>4. Mention three mammals that hibernate.</p>

<p>5. Describe the methods of defense in the following
mammals: Armadillo, Porcupine, Skunk.</p>

<p>6. Why do the front teeth of the Squirrel and the
Beaver continue to grow?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>The best way to find the answers to these questions is
by actual observation of the animals, but when this is
impossible, the references given under "Mammals" will
be found useful.</p>

<p>The love of the beautiful seems to be innate; that is,
born in us. And the birds appeal to this in at least two
ways: First, on account of the beauty of their songs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and second, on account of the beauty of their plumage.</p>

<p>Among the birds that have especially beautiful songs
are the Thrushes, which include the Robin and the Bluebird,
the finest singer in this family probably being the
Hermit Thrush. In the Southern States there is no more
popular singer among the birds than the Mockingbird.
But it should be remembered that a bird's song cannot
be separated from the associations which it calls up in
one's memory. So that the performance of an ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
songster may be more pleasing to one than that of some
finer one because of youthful associations.</p>

<p>Among the birds that we enjoy on account of their
beautiful plumage are the Egrets, every feather of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
coats being as white as snow, and the plumes of these
birds are so beautiful, and human beings have been so
thoughtless that the Egrets have been almost exterminated
in order to supply the millinery trade. These plumes,
known as aigrettes, grow on the backs between the shoulders
of both the male and female birds, and are worn
only during the nesting season. The only time during the
nesting season that the plume hunter finds it profitable to
hunt these birds is when the young are in the nest. At any
other time the birds would be so wild that the plume hunter
could not easily shoot them. When the young are in
the nest the parental love is so strong that the adult birds
cannot resist the instinct to return to feed the nestlings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
when they are begging for food. In this way both the
father bird and the mother bird become an easy prey
for the ambushed plume hunter, and there is but one
thing that can happen to the baby Egrets in the nest
after both of their parents have been killed&mdash;they starve
to death. This is one of the most cruel phases of the
plume trade, and there is no other way to secure the
aigrette plumes of the Egrets than by killing the adult
birds. Fortunately, in the United States it is against
the law to shoot these birds, and it is against the law
to import the plumes. Until recently it has not been
illegal to wear these plumes, and the fact that there
are still a few women who adorn their hats with them
has encouraged the illegal and cruel killing of these
birds in our country, or the smuggling in of the plumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
from some other country. In the latter part of 1919
the federal regulations have been interpreted to make it
illegal to possess aigrette plumes, and henceforth the
law will be so enforced. This is the successful culmination
of a long fight by the Audubon Society.</p>

<p>Every farmer and gardener must cultivate his crops
and fight the weeds which are always crowding out the
plants he is trying to raise, and in this fight he is helped
by a great many birds of various kinds. Among these
are the Mourning Dove, the Bob-White, and members<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
of the Sparrow family, such as the Goldfinch, the Junco,
and the Song Sparrow. In this country, in the aggregate,
these seed-eating birds destroy every year tons of
seeds of the noxious weeds, and are therefore valuable
friends of the gardener and farmer. For more definite
data see bulletins published by the U. S. Department
of Agriculture, or "Useful Birds and Their Protection,"
by Edward Howe Forbush (Massachusetts Board of
Agriculture).</p>

<p>Thousands of bushels of grain are eaten or spoiled
by small mammals, such as mice, rats, and spermophiles
or gophers. To the relief of the farmer, many
birds feed upon these destructive little rodents. The
Crow occasionally captures a mouse, while the Shrikes
or Butcher-birds catch a great many. The Screech Owl
feeds largely upon mice. The Red-tailed Hawk is
called the Hen-hawk or Chicken-hawk by most farmers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
but this is very unfair to the bird, for its principal food
is mice. In fact, most of the Hawks and Owls of the
United States are really valuable friends of the farmer
because of the injurious rodents which they devour.
(See "<i>Hawks and Owls of the United States</i>," by A.
K. Fisher.)</p>

<p>To be fair, it must be admitted that there are a few
exceptions; that is, that there are a few Hawks and
Owls which do more harm than good. The Sharp-shinned
Hawk kills many harmless songbirds and occasionally
young game birds and young chickens. The
Cooper's Hawk, which nests throughout the United
States, is a real chicken hawk, and the worst one in the
country. The Duck Hawk, the "Noble Peregrine" of
falconry, in this country feeds largely upon domestic
pigeons, but no bird student would wish to see it exterminated
on account of this habit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>There are a number of birds which are valuable
friends to all the people because they are scavengers.
The Herring Gull, which is the commonest gull of the
harbors of the United States, and which is also found
on inland lakes and rivers, by feeding upon all kinds
of refuse animal and plant materials makes the waters
about our cities more healthful. This is especially true
of the coast cities which dump their garbage into the
waters not far distant. The Turkey Vulture, the Black
Vulture or Carrion-Crow, and the California Condor
make the fields and woods of the country more healthful
by devouring the carcasses of animals, and the first
two species eat the offal from slaughter houses and even
scraps of meat from the markets in some of our Southern
cities.</p>

<p>The most valuable group of birds from the standpoint
of the farmers, the orchardists, and the gardeners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
is the insect-eating birds. Among these are the Wood
Pewee, the Phoebe, the Kingbird, and all of the Flycatchers;
the Purple Martin and all of the Swallows;
the Nighthawk and Whip-poor-will. The Yellow-billed
and Black-billed Cuckoos and the Baltimore Oriole feed
largely upon tent caterpillars and others caterpillars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
which defoliate the fruit and shade trees. The Sparrow
Hawk has been wrongly named, for it eats a thousand
times as many grasshoppers as it does sparrows. The
Chickadees, Brown Creepers, and many of the Warblers
feed largely upon insects and insect eggs which they
glean chiefly from the trees. The Rose-breasted Grosbeak
and the Bob-White eat the Colorado potato-beetle.
In the West the Franklin's Gull follows the farmer in
the fields and picks up great numbers of destructive
insects.</p>

<p>In learning the value of our feathered friends it is
necessary to learn to know the birds, and in this quest
great help can be obtained from books. Beginners will
find the following useful:</p>

<p>"Land Birds East of the Rockies," by Chester A.
Reed.</p>

<p>"Water and Game Birds," by Chester A. Reed.</p>

<p>"Western Bird Guide," by Chester A. Reed. (All
published by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.)</p>

<p>For more advanced students the following are recommended:</p>

<p>"Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America," by
Frank M. Chapman (D. Appleton &amp; Co.).</p>

<p>"Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America," by
Florence Merriam Bailey (Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co.).</p>

<p>Our study of birds should not stop with the name, because
we shall find many things of interest in the home
life of birds, many things that seem to reflect our own
lives. (See "Home Life of Wild Birds," by F. H. Herrick.
G. P. Putnam's Sons.)</p>

<p>If we like to hear birds sing, if we enjoy the beauty
of their coats, and if they are valuable neighbors from
the standpoint of dollars and cents, then it is worth
while to consider how we may have more of them about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
our homes. Every girl can do a great deal to attract
birds.</p>

<p>First, by putting up nesting boxes. Since the people
of our country have destroyed so much of our native
forests and undergrowth, have drained so many of our
swamps, and have cultivated so much of the grassy
prairie, many birds have difficulty in finding suitable
places to nest. This can be remedied in the case of
birds that nest in cavities, such as the House Wren,
Tree Swallow, Purple Martin, Screech Owl, Chickadee,
and Bluebird, by putting up nesting boxes. For
those that nest in shrubbery, like the Catbird and the
Brown Thrasher, shrubs and vines may be planted so
that the desirable tangle may be had.</p>

<span class="caption">A MOTHER MALLARD AND HER FAMILY<br />

The Wild Mallard is the original of many of the domesticated
ducks. Range: Northern Hemisphere.</span>
</div>

<p>Second, by putting out bird baths. In this improved
country of ours, there are doubtless large areas in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
wild birds have difficulty in finding suitable places to
bathe. Artificial bird baths are more attractive to
birds in the summer time than during cold weather, but
they will be used even in winter if kept free from ice.
Do not place a bird bath so close to a shrub, tree, or
building that a house cat may stalk the birds from behind
it. The house cat is probably the worst enemy of
our native songbirds.</p>

<p>Third, by establishing feeding stations, especially in
winter when snow covers the natural food of so many
birds. When birds have enough to eat they rarely suffer
severely from the cold.</p>

<p>Fourth, by cooperating with the authorities in seeing
that the laws protecting the birds are enforced.</p>

<p>The Audubon Society has done much effective work
along these lines, and a Girl Scout should join this society,
whose headquarters are 1974 Broadway, New York

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>All nature is so full that that district produces
the greatest variety which is most examined.</i></p>

<div class='right'>
&mdash;<i>Gilbert White, Natural History of Selborne.</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>The group of back-boned animals next above the fishes
is the Amphibians, which includes the frogs, toads, salamanders,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and their relatives. The name "amphibian"
refers to two modes of life as shown by most of the
frogs and toads. A good example is the Common Toad,
whose eggs are laid in the water. These eggs hatch out
not into toads, but into tadpoles, which have no legs and
which breathe by means of gills, as the fishes do. They
grow rapidly, develop a pair of hind legs and then a pair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
of front legs, while the tail and gills are absorbed, all
within a little more than a month from the time the eggs
are laid. During this change a pair of lungs is developed,
so that the toads breathe air as human beings do.
The eggs of toads and frogs may be collected in the
spring in ponds, and this remarkable change from the
egg through the tadpole stage to the adult form may be
observed in a simple home aquarium. Toads' eggs may
be distinguished from those of frogs by the fact that
toads' eggs are laid in strings, while frogs' eggs are laid
in masses.</p>

<p>Every Girl Scout should know the song of the toad.
William Hamilton Gibson says it is "the sweetest sound
in nature." (<i>Sharp Eyes</i>, p. 54.) If you do not know it,
take a lantern or electric flash-lamp after dark some evening
in the spring at egg-laying time, and go to the
edge of some pond and see the toad sing. Notice how
the throat is puffed out while the note is being produced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>The belief that warts are caused by handling toads has
no foundation in fact.</p>

<p>The toad is a valuable friend of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'gardner'">gardener</ins>, for it
feeds upon a great variety of destructive insects.</p>

<p>The life of our Salamanders is very similar to that
of the frogs and toads. The eggs hatch out into tadpoles,
then legs are developed, but the tail is not absorbed.
Unlike the frogs and toads, the Salamander
keeps its tail throughout life, and in some kinds of Salamanders
which spend all of their time in the water, the
gills are used throughout life. Salamanders have various
common names, some being called newts, others
water-dogs or mud-puppies. The mud-eel and the Congo
"snake" of the Southern States, and the "hell-bender"
of the Ohio valley and south are all Salamanders. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
belief that any of the Salamanders is poisonous is a
myth and has no basis in fact.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Reptiles</b></div>

<p>Reptiles include Alligators, Crocodiles, Turtles, Lizards
and Snakes. It is commonly said that reptiles are
cold-blooded. This means that the temperature of their
blood varies and is the same as the surrounding medium.
The temperature of an Alligator that has been floating
with its nose out of the water is the same as the surrounding
water. The temperature of a turtle in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
winter time is the same as the mud in which it is buried,
while in the summer time it is much higher. What is
true of the reptiles in respect to temperature is also true
of Amphibians and Fishes. However, this is not true
of Birds and Mammals, for these have a uniform temperature
so high that they are called warm-blooded.</p>

Arizona and New Mexico.</span>
</div>

<p>In the United States there is but one species of Alligator
and but one species of Crocodile, both limited to
the Southeastern States.</p>

<p>There are about fifty kinds of Turtle and Tortoises
in North America, some of which live on the land and
feed largely upon plants, <i>e. g.</i>, the Common Box Turtle,
found from the New England States to South Carolina
and westward to Kansas, and the Gopher Tortoise
of the Southern States. Others are aquatic, like the
Painted Turtles, which are found in one form or another
practically all over the United States.</p>

<p>Many of these reptiles are highly prized as food, <i>e. g.</i>,
Diamond-backed Terrapin, Soft-shelled Turtle, Snapping
Turtle and Gopher Tortoise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>There are about one hundred species of Lizards in
North America, the greatest number being found in the
drier parts of the continent. Of this whole number only
two species are poisonous, and only one of these, the
Gila Monster, is found within the United States, being
confined in its range to desert regions of Southern Arizona
and New Mexico.</p>

<p>The Blue-tailed Lizard or Skink, which occurs from
Massachusetts to Florida and westward to Central Texas,
is commonly believed to be poisonous in the Southern
States, where it is called the Red-headed "Scorpion," but
this is one of the popular myths still too common among
intelligent people.</p>

<p>The Glass "Snake" of the Central and Southern States
is a peculiar lizard in that it has no legs. That it is able,
after being broken to pieces, to collect itself together
again and continue to live is another old myth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>About a dozen kinds of Horned "Toads" are found
in the western portions of the United States. Although
toad-like in the shape of their bodies and in some of
their habits, they are really lizards.</p>

<p>The American Chameleon or "Green" Lizard, which
ranges in this country in the coastal regions from North
Carolina to the Rio Grande River, has a remarkable
power of changing the color of its skin through shades
of brown, gray, and green. In fact, it is said to rival
or possibly excel the true chameleons of the Old World.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>FISHES</b><br />

<i>"It is not all of fishing to fish."</i></div>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>The fishes are the lowest of the true vertebrates or
animals with backbones, and all live in the water. They
do not have lungs, but breathe through gills on the sides
of the head. They are cold-blooded animals; i. e., the
temperature of the blood is the same as that of the water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
in which they are living. Fishes are found in both fresh
and salt water all over the world and have adapted themselves
to many conditions; for example, certain fishes
have lived in caves so long that they are blind; some live
in the coldest water, while others can revel in the heat
of the hot springs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">COMMON CATFISH<br />

The barbels which suggest the whiskers of a cat are responsible
for the name. This fish has no scales. Range: Eastern and
Central United States.</span>
</div>

<p>Many fishes are valuable as food and the fisheries are
extensive industries, in which large sums of money are
invested.</p>

<p>There are four great groups of fishes:</p>

<p>1. The sharks and rays, with cartilaginous skeletons.</p>

<p>2. The ganoids of which the sturgeon and garpike are
examples, with heavy plates or scales.</p>

<p>3. The bony fishes&mdash;salmon, pickerel, mackerel, cod,
halibut, etc.</p>

<p>4. The lung fishes, that live partly in air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i116.jpg" width="550" height="326" alt="SHOVEL-NOSED STURGEON This fish is covered with bony plates instead of scales. The roe is made into caviar. Range: Upper and middle Mississippi Valley." title="" />
<span class="caption">SHOVEL-NOSED STURGEON<br />This fish is covered with bony plates instead of scales. The roe is made into caviar. Range: Upper and middle Mississippi Valley.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many species of sharks. Among the more
common ones in Atlantic waters are the Smooth Dogfish
which have pavement-like teeth; the Sand Shark with catlike
teeth; the Hammerhead Shark with its eyes on
stalks. The near relatives of the sharks are the Skates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
The most common example of the ganoid fish is the
sturgeon, which is heavily clad with a bony armor. Most
of the fishes that we find, however, belong to the third
group, i. e., bony fishes. Among the salt-water species,
the cod, the halibut, the mackerel, and the bluefish are
especially valuable as food. Of the salt-water fishes
that go up the rivers into fresh water to breed, the
salmon and the shad are widely known. Of a strictly
fresh-water fish, the sunfish and catfish are very common.
Among the game-fish are the trout, bass, pickerel,
and salmon.</p>

<p>For those who live in cities, a convenient place to begin
the study of fishes is in the fish-market. Here we may
learn to know the common food-fishes by name, and to
know many interesting things about them. If there is a
Public Aquarium or a Natural History Museum in your
city, you can use it in connection with the fish-market.
Especially valuable in Museums are the habitat groups of
fishes, that is, those in which the fishes are shown in their
natural surroundings. But, best of all, the place to study
fishes, as is true of all other animals, is out-of-doors in
their native haunts. With your dip-net or hook and line,
catch the fish, and then by the aid of one of the books
listed below find out what its name is. Then, by observation
of the fish see what is interesting in its life-history.
Find out where the mother-fish lays her eggs. Does
either parents guard them? Has the fish any natural
weapons of defense? If so, what are they? Does either
parent care for the young after they are hatched? What
does the fish feed upon? In what way is the fish protectively
colored? In the study of fishes, an interesting
means is the home aquarium. Any Girl Scout can easily
learn how to install and maintain a balanced aquarium,
that is, one in which the water does not have to be changed
and in fact should not be changed. In such an aquarium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
one may keep and study a great variety of fishes. Some
of our local fishes, such as young catfish and suckers,
will prove fully as interesting as the goldfish and many
other animals besides fishes will thrive in a small aquarium,
such as tadpoles of frogs, toads, and salamanders,
adult water-newts, soft-shelled turtles, snails, and water-beetles
and nymphs of dragon-flies.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Animals Without Backbones</b></div>

<p>In general the Invertebrates are animals without a
backbone; that is, they do not have an internal supporting
skeleton of bone, as does the dog or cat. Compared
with mammals or birds, they are all small and some
are so very tiny that they can be seen only with a very
powerful microscope. Most of them live in the water
or in the mud or sand under the water. Hence the best
place to get acquainted with them is along the seashore
or near some lake or stream.</p>

<p>There are several different groups of Invertebrates
and between these groups there are greater differences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
of structure than there is between a horse and a hummingbird.
The principal groups are:</p>

<p>1. The Protozoa, or one-celled animals (nearly all
microscopic).</p>

<p>2. The Sponges.</p>

<p>3. The Jellyfishes, Sea-anemones, and Corals.</p>

<p>4. Worms of several groups.</p>

<p>5. Starfishes, Sea-urchins, and Sea-cucumbers.</p>

<p>6. Segmented Worms.</p>

<p>7. Crabs, Lobsters, etc.</p>

<p>8. Oysters, Snails, and Octopi.</p>

<p>9. Insects and Spiders.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>Seashore Life</b></div>

<p>Because of their connection with our industries or
our food supply, some of the Invertebrates are familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
to all; for instance, sponges, corals, starfishes, crabs,
shrimps, lobsters, clams, and oysters. Others are seldom
seen unless one takes pains to look for them.</p>

<p>All life comes from pre-existing life. So every animal
living to-day has come from some other living animal
and every plant living to-day has come from some other
previously living plant. It is believed that the first forms
of life came from the water. At any rate, the oldest and
lowest forms of life to-day, the Protozoa, are found in
the water. As these are nearly all very minute and can
be studied only with a microscope, they are omitted from
the suggested field work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>All who have access to the seashore have a wonderful
opportunity to study the Invertebrates. The long stretches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
of sandy beach, the sections of shore covered with water-rolled
pebbles and stones, even the steep, jagged cliffs,
are all pebbled with these animals of the sea. Twice
every twenty-four hours the sea water creeps slowly up
the beach until high water is reached, and twice every
twenty-four hours it recedes again toward the ocean.
It is therefore about twelve hours from one low water
to the next. On a gently sloping beach, the distances
between the high water mark and the low water mark
may be many hundreds of feet, while on a steep beach
or a straight cliff this area may be only a few feet in
width. It is this area between the high and low water
marks that is the haunt of many Invertebrates. These
are animals that can live if they are not continually
covered with water. Here are the rock barnacles, the
soft clams, crabs of many kinds, beach fleas, numerous
sea worms in their special houses, snails, and hermit
crabs. Others will be found in the pools between the
rocks or in the crevices of the cliffs, which as the
tide falls becomes great natural aquaria. Here will be
found hydroids, sea-anemones, starfishes, sea-urchins,
barnacles, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'muscles'">mussels</ins>. In the shallow water, crabs and
shrimps are crawling along the sandy bottom or are lying
concealed in the mud, while schools of little fishes scoot
across the pool. If a fine silk net is drawn through the
water and then emptied into a glass dish a whole new
world of creatures will be revealed&mdash;jellyfishes, ctenophores,
hydroids, eggs of fish, tiny copepods, the larvae or
young of sea-urchins, starfishes, or oysters. If an old
wharf is near by, examine the posts supporting it. The
pilings seem to be coated with a shaggy mass of seaweed.
Scrape some of this off and put in a dish of water. Sea-spiders,
starfishes, hydroids that look like moss, sea-anemones,
many varieties of worms, mussels and crabs
are all living here.</p>

<p>Begin your study of these seashore animals with a
stroll along the beach. Examine the windrows of seawrack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
or seaweed. Whole troops of sandhoppers rise
ahead of you. Oftentimes animals from distant shores
or deep water will be found. The empty shells have
many a story to tell. The papery egg-cases of the periwinkle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
remind one of a beautiful necklace. The air
bubbles rising from the sand or mud as the wave recedes
mark the entrance to the burrows of worms.
Stamp hard on the sand. A little fountain of water
announces the abode of the soft clam. Watch the sand
at the edges of the rippling water. The mole-crab may
be seen scuttling to cover. In the little hollows between
rocks a rock-crab or a green-crab may be found on
guard.</p>

<p>Insects play an important part in Nature's activities.
From the point of view of man some are beneficial and
some are destructive. In the former group may be
mentioned the Dragonflies which feed upon mosquitoes,
the Cochineal insects of Mexico, which furnish a dye-stuff,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
the Lady-bird beetles, which in the larval stage feed
upon plant lice; the scale insects of India, which furnish
shellac; the Bumblebees, which cross-pollinate the
clover, and the Wasps, which fertilize the figs. Dr. Lutz
says that the manna which fed the Children of Israel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
was honeydew secreted by a scale insect, and that it is
still eaten.</p>

Range: Eastern United States. The pupa climbing tree trunk.

</div>

<p>The Silkworm and the Honey-bee have been domesticated
since prehistoric times, the former supplying a
valuable fiber for clothing and the latter an important
article of food.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the injurious insects a few may be mentioned:
the House Fly or Filth Fly, which may carry disease
germs on its feet to the food that we eat; the mosquitoes,
which transmit yellow fever and malaria, the rat flea,
which carries bubonic plague; the weevils, which destroy
rice, beans, chestnuts, etc., and the plant lice, or aphids,
which, by sucking the juices from ornamental and food
plants, are among the most destructive of all insects.</p>

<p>There are so many insects in the world that we cannot
hope to learn of them all, even if we wanted to do so, but
most of us wish to know the names of those that attract
our attention, and to know what they do that is important
or interesting. There are approximately 400,000
species or kinds of insects known in the world; that is,
about three times as many as there are species or kinds
of all the rest of the animals in the world put together.
This fact should not hinder us from making a start and
becoming familiar with the interesting habits of a few
of the insects about us.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Monarch Butterfly may be collected
upon the milkweed and brought in, so that the whole
life history or metamorphosis of this beautiful insect,
from the egg through the larva or caterpillar stage and
the pupa or chrysalis stage to the adult butterfly, may be
watched. The larvae or caterpillar must be supplied
daily with fresh milkweed leaves. Other butterflies and
moths and many other insects may be reared in the same
way by supplying the larvae with suitable food. If we
should find a caterpillar feeding upon the leaves of a
maple tree we should continue to feed it maple leaves
if we wish to rear it. Silkworms will eat the leaves of
Osage-orange, but they seem to prefer <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mullberry'">mulberry</ins> leaves.</p>

<p>Cocoons of moths may be easily collected in winter
after the leaves have fallen, and brought in and kept in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
a cool place until spring when the coming out of the
adult moths will be an occurrence of absorbing interest.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>The Structure and History of the Earth</b></div>

<p>There is nothing eternal about the earth except eternal
change, some one has said. It requires only a little looking
about us to see that this is true. The earth is not as
it was in the past. Every shower of rain changes or
modifies its surface. And many other and some very
great changes have occurred during the past few millions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
of years. During one age, the coal was formed of plants
that grew luxuriantly on the earth's surface. At one
period in the development of the earth there were many
kinds of invertebrate animals, but no animals with backbones.
Later, the vertebrates appeared. At one time the
whole Mississippi Valley was under the water of the sea.
("The Story of Our Continent," by N. S. Shaler. Ginn
&amp; Co.). These statements suggest just a few of the
things that have been going on in the history of the earth.
By the study of Geology we can learn much more about
it, and we should supplement our study of books with the
more important actual observation of conditions out-of-doors.
To those living in that part of North America,
which is shaded in the map on <a href="#Page_451">page 451</a>, the easiest and
most natural approach to the subject of the structure and
history of the earth is by studying the effects of the
continental glacier which formerly moved down over
this region.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Tracks of the Glacier</b></div>

<p>When we see the foot-prints of an animal in the mud
or in the snow, we are sure that an animal has passed
that way at some previous time. Those who live in Canada
or northern United States (See map <a href="#Page_451">page 451</a>) can be
just as sure that a great glacier or ice-sheet formerly
moved down over northern North America, by the tracks
it has left. Although it is estimated by geologists that
between 10,000 and 40,000 years have elapsed since the
Great Ice Age, these tracks or evidences can still be seen
by any one who lives in this region or who can visit it.
The principal ones are: (1) Boulders or Lost Rocks
which were brought down by this glacier; (2) The Glacial
Drift or Boulder Clay which covers nearly all of the
glaciated region; (3) Scratches on the bed-rock which
show the direction the glacier moved.</p>

<p>Notice in the field the size and shape of the glacial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
boulders, where they are found, evidence of the place
where the glacier melted off (terminal moraine). Do
these boulders increase or decrease in size as we go south
over the glaciated area? Can you discover any place
where they can be traced back in their native ledge?
Present-day glaciers, like the Muir Glacier in Alaska,
can be seen transporting boulders and drift just as this
great prehistoric ice-sheet must have done.</p>

<p>The drift which consists of clay mixed with pebbles,
cobblestones, and boulders, varies greatly in depth. In
some places there is none, while at St. Paris, Ohio, it is
550 feet deep. It probably averages 100 feet thick or less.</p>

<p>In your locality note the depth of the drifts in cuts made
naturally by creeks and rivers or those made artificially
for railroads. Oil-wells furnish evidence on this point.
Collect a few good examples of scratched or glaciated
pebbles or cobblestones which are abundant in the drift.
These were scratched while frozen in the bottom of the
glacier and pushed along on the bed-rock under the weight
of the ice above.</p>

<p>Collect ten different kinds of rock from the glacial
boulders and drift,&mdash;there are more than one hundred
kinds to be found,&mdash;and with the aid of some such book
as "Rocks and Rock Minerals," by Louis V. Pirsson
(John Wiley &amp; Sons) or "Common Minerals and Rocks,"
by Wm. O. Crosby (D. C. Heath &amp; Co.) try to identify
them.</p>

<p>All soil is composed of disintegrated or decayed rock.
And it has been observed that the soil of northern North
America is foreign to the bed-rock. Therefore it must
have been transported from some other place. The
glacier did this huge piece of work. The soil of southern
United States contains no boulders or cobblestones and
has been formed by the disintegration and decay of rocks
in place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>Observe glacial scratches and grooves on the bed-rock,
those on Kelley's Island in Lake Erie are famous.</p>

<p>Agassiz was the first to realize that it was a glacier that
did this stupendous piece of work, and this conception or
discovery greatly added to his fame. It is now easy for
us to find the evidences and to enjoy their interpretation.</p>

<p>In fact, the Greenland ice-sheet is a remnant of this
prehistoric continental glacier.</p>

<h3>GIRL SCOUT'S OWN GARDEN</h3>

<div class='center'><small>BY DAVID M. HUNTER</small><br /><br /></div>

<i>A Garden is a lovesome thing, God wot!</i><br />

</div>

<div class='sig'>
&mdash;<i>Thomas Edward Brown.</i><br />
</div>

<p>A very old story tells us that when man was created
he was put by the Creator into a garden to dress it and
to keep it. He could not have been put into a better
place nor could a more honorable and necessary occupation
have been given to him. No doubt the woman who
lived in the garden with him aided him in this work.
Not having a house to care for or dressmaking and
sewing to do, or cooking to take her attention, there
was nothing to prevent her from helping in the dressing
and keeping of the lovely garden. At any rate, that is
what Milton thought, for he makes Adam speak to Eve
of "our delightful task to prune these growing plants
and tend these flowers."</p>

<p>Two persons would not need a very large garden,
and I will commend this early example to the beginner
in gardening and urge a very small garden to start
with. For it is well to undertake only what can be
easily handled or what can be done thoroughly. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
is joy in the contemplation of a perfect work, even
though it be on a small scale, that never comes from
a more ambitious undertaking imperfectly carried out.
Better six square feet of well tilled, weedless, thrifty
garden than an acre poorly cultivated and full of weeds.</p>

<p>A Girl Scout who proposes to make a garden will
naturally ask herself certain questions. If she has the
ground, if she knows already where her garden is to be
placed, the next thing, perhaps, that she will wish to
know is, what tools will be needed. Then follows the
way to treat the soil in order to prepare it for planting
the seeds. After that comes the question of seeds and
the way to plant them. Then the cultivation of the
crops until they are ready to be gathered.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have material for short sections on
(1) tools, (2) preparation of the soil, (3) selection of
seeds, (4) planting, and (5) cultivation.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>(1) Tools</b></div>

<p>Not many tools will be needed, but some seem to be
indispensable. I would suggest: 1. A spading fork.
Some like a long-handled fork, others prefer a short-handled
one. 2. A hoe. 3. A garden or iron-toothed
rake. 4. A hand weeder of some kind. 5. A shovel.
In addition to these tools every gardener will find it
necessary to have a line for making straight rows. This
should be at least the length of the longest dimension
of the garden and white that it may be easily seen.
There should be two pegs to stick it in with. I should
add a board about ten inches wide with straight edges
and as long as the bed is wide, and a pointed stick.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>(2) The Preparation of the Seed Bed</b></div>

<p>The first thing to do, after having determined the
location of your garden, is to measure your bed. If
you have a single bed, one twelve feet long by six feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
wide is enough to start with. I should prefer, however,
to have two beds, each three feet wide by twelve feet
long with a narrow path between, say, twelve inches.
The reason for thus laying out the ground in two beds
is that it will be easier to reach the whole bed from
either side without stepping or kneeling on the cultivated
soil. All cultivation can be done from the paths.</p>

<p><i>The soil</i> for flower beds needs most careful preparation.
The bed should be dug out to a depth of two
feet, and if the soil is clay, two feet six inches. In the
latter case, put broken stones, cinders or gravel on the
bottom for drainage. The soil should be a mixture of
one-half good sandy loam, one-fourth leaf mould or muck
that has been left out all winter. Mix these thoroughly
together before filling the beds, sprinkle wood ashes over
the beds and rake them in before planting. This is to
sweeten the soil. Lime may be used for the same purpose,
but in either case get advice as to the amount needed
for the soil in question.</p>

<p><i>Manure.</i> Next in order will come the enriching of
this plot of ground by spreading upon it a good coating
of well rotted cow manure. In case barnyard manure
is not available, a good mixture of commercial fertilizer
consists of four parts ground bone to one of muriate of
potash applied at the rate of four pounds to the square
rod. This done, proceed to fork the whole piece over,
thrusting the spading fork into the ground its full length
each time, and turning the forkful of earth so that the
manure will be covered and not lie on top of the ground.</p>

<p>When the spading has been done, then use your rake
and spare it not. Rake until the earth in the beds is
finely pulverized and until the whole bed is as level as
you can make it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>Now construct your central or dividing path, throwing
the soil moved on the beds on either side. To do
this you will need a shovel.</p>

<p>Next define or limit your beds, making the sides and
ends as straight as possible. You ought now to have
two rectangular beds, each three feet by twelve feet,
with a narrow path separating them all ready to put in
the seeds. It would be a good thing to have your beds
raised a little, two or three inches above the general
level of the surrounding earth. This will make them
more distinct and will obviate the settling of water on
your beds; in other words, will drain them.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Seeds</b></div>

<p>The principal counsel to be given here is to use great
care in the selection of seeds because it is a bitter disappointment
and a discouraging experience to find that
after all your labor your seeds are worthless. It would
be well to test a sample of your seeds to determine their
germinating power. If you have a reliable friend from
whom you can secure your seeds, you are fortunate, but
if you must purchase at the dealer by all means patronize
one of established reputation.</p>

<p>For the first garden I should plant lettuce, radishes,
beets and beans in one of the beds. The other bed may
be devoted to flowers.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Planting</b></div>

<p>Your beds are now supposed to be all ready for the
seeds. That is to say, they are shaped and graded and
raked fine. The next thing to do is to lay your board
across the bed, with one edge six inches from the edge
of the bed. Then stand on the board and with a pointed
stick make a shallow furrow on each side of the board
close to the board. Here I should put the lettuce. It
is desirable to have the seeds evenly and not too thickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
distributed in the shallow furrows. One way of accomplishing
this is by mixing your seeds with some very fine
wood ashes in a bowl and spreading the mixed ashes and
seeds along the furrows. A better way, I think, in the
case of a small quantity of seeds would be to place each
seed at a proper distance from the others. This distance
will vary according to the size of the full grown heads
of lettuce. The smaller varieties might stand six inches
apart, while the largest ones would need to be twice that
distance or more.</p>

<p>Having planted your lettuce seeds, turn your board
over carefully twice. That will bring it into position
for two more rows of vegetables. Stand on the board
again and proceed as before, making two shallow furrows
with a pointed stick. Here I should put the radish
seeds. These may be sown more thickly, for the reason
that as soon as the radishes become large enough
to eat they may be pulled out, leaving room for the
rest of the radishes to develop.</p>

<p>Having planted your radish seeds, repeat the preceding
operations, making two furrows again, this time for
beet seeds. These may also be sown thickly. The plants
may be thinned out afterward. The small plants that
are pulled out will make excellent greens. When the
thinning is completed the remaining plants should stand
from four to six inches apart, according to variety;
some beets are much larger than others.</p>

<p>The rest of the bed devote to string or butter beans.
You will have left for these a space of eighty-eight
inches, or a little more than seven feet. The rows of
beans must be farther apart than the other vegetables
you have planted. Two feet between the rows is not
too much. You will have space enough for three rows.
Measure from your last row of beets one foot six inches
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>at each side of your bed. Now stretch your line across
your bed at this distance from the beets, then with a
hoe make a furrow close to the line. This furrow
should be two inches deep at least. Much deeper, you
see, than the shallow furrows for the smaller seeds.
Having made this furrow, measure two feet from it on
each side of the bed and place your line at this point
and make a furrow as before. Repeat the process for
a third furrow. You should now have left a space of
eighteen inches between your last furrow and the end
of the bed. Into these three furrows place the beans,
spacing them.</p>

<p>Your seeds are now all in. At this juncture take
your rake and cover the seeds, leaving the whole bed
level and smooth.</p>

<p>There is nothing more to be done just at present except
to leave these seeds to the forces of nature, to the
darkness and the moisture and the warmth of their
earthy bed. They are put to bed not that they may
sleep, but in order to wake them up. Soon the delicate
shoots will begin to appear above the ground, and
with them will also appear the shoots of many weeds
whose seeds were in the soil. These weeds constitute a
call to your next operation which is</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Cultivation</b></div>

<p>Declare war on the weeds. Use your hand weeder
between the rows of smaller vegetables and let not a
weed escape. If they are in the rows so near to the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stedlings'">seedlings</ins> that you cannot use the weeder without danger
to the delicate little plants that you are attending,
then employ your fingers.</p>

<p>For a time you may use the hoe or rake between the
rows of beans, but even here near the paths themselves
the weeder or hands should be preferred.</p>

<p>There is one caution that old gardeners give which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
is not to work among beans when they are wet with
dew or rain for fear of "rust." Wait till the sun has
dried the foliage.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Frequent and thorough cultivation not only destroys
the weeds, thus giving your vegetables a better chance
and giving your garden a tidy, well-kept appearance,
but it keeps the soil loose and forms a sort of mulch
whereby the moisture is conserved. The dryer the season
the greater the need of cultivation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It may seem to you that you are obliged to wait long
and spend a good deal of labor without results, but
when you have for the breakfast table some cool, crisp
radishes and for dinner a head of fresh lettuce, and
later a dish of sweet, luscious beets or mess of string
beans, you will feel well repaid.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the other bed, in
which you are to grow flowers. This may be treated
as a sort of background for the vegetable bed. To
do this let the rows of plants run the other way. That
is to say, lengthwise of the bed instead of across. It is
assumed that the ground has been treated as in the
case of the vegetable bed.</p>

<p>When you have accomplished this work of preparation
set <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'you'">your</ins> line six inches from the side of the bed
nearest your vegetables, or the patch between the two
beds. Make a shallow furrow the full length of the
bed with your pointed stick. In this furrow sow your
flower seeds of some low-growing plant such as <i>sweet
alyssum</i>. Then move your line back toward the other
side of the bed one foot. Here you should place some
taller plants, such as <i>asters</i>. The aster plants should
have been raised in the house, or purchased from some
grower. Again move your line one foot nearer the rear
margin of your bed and in this row plant your tallest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
plants. <i>Dahlias</i> or <i>cosmos</i> would be very effective.
You must get the roots for the dahlias somewhere.
Cosmos is planted from seeds. In planting the dahlias
it would be well to dig a hole for each plant so deep
that when the root is set it will be two or three inches
below the surface of the ground. Good results will be
obtained if before putting in the roots you put a handful
or two of good manure in the hole and sprinkle a
little soil over it.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these particular plants simply as
specimens. Other choices may be made and a suggested
list is given at the end of this section. But whatever
the selection, two things should be kept in mind. First,
that the rows should contain plants that vary in height,
the lowest being placed in the front row, the tallest at
the back; and second, that plants should be chosen that
will be in bloom at the same time, for at least a part
of the season.</p>

<p>If your work has been well done you ought to have
a small bed of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'vegtables'">vegetables</ins>, thrifty, in straight rows, well
cultivated, clean, and back of that, looking from the
side, another bed of flowering plants that should be a
delight to the eye, especially the eye of the possessor
and maker. Of course, the beds will not present this
perfect appearance for a long time because as the vegetables
are used the beds will show where the vegetables
have been removed. It should be mentioned, however,
that it is possible to have more than one planting of
radishes in a season; also of lettuce, and these may be
replaced after the first planting has been used.</p>

<p>There are many satisfactions in gardening. The intimacy
with nature furnishes one of them. To be with
growing things through all the stages of their growth,
in all weathers and all hours of the day gives a quiet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>pleasure that is a healing and soothing influence. To
produce something so valuable, so necessary as food
by one's own exertion and care confers true dignity
upon one and a sense of worth. To eat what one has
raised oneself adds a flavor to it.</p>

<p>From the garden as a center path, lead out in every
direction, paths for thought and study.</p>

<p>My wish for every Girl Scout who undertakes a garden
is that she may have all these satisfactions, and
may follow all these delightful paths that lead to knowledge,
and through knowledge to joy.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Suggested Flowers for Border</b></div>

<p><i>Biennials</i> such as Canterbury Bells, Foxgloves and
Sweet William should be seeded early in the spring in a
reserve bed to be ready for the season's bloom. In order
to secure a succession of bloom they should be taken
out after flowering and replaced with annuals.</p>

<p><i>Annuals</i>&mdash;Of these some of the most satisfactory are
Asters, Calendula, Lupin, Petunias, Rosy Morn, Snapdragon,
Stock and Rose Zinnias.</p>

<p>Take out any plants that are not the right colors.
Brown earth is better than purple annual Larkspur, magenta
Petunias, orange Calendulas or red Zinnias. Keep
the color scheme ranging from true blues through rose
and salmon pinks, lavenders and deep blue purples and
white yellows. If you want brilliant reds or magentas
have them in a bed apart.</p>

<p><i>Bulbs</i>&mdash;Tulips, such as Murillo, or <i>early varieties</i> (La
Reine, Pink Beauty, President Lincoln, Proserpine,
Queen of the Netherlands and Rose Luisante), or <i>late
varieties</i> (La Merveille, La Reve, Moonlight, The Fawn)
and Mertensiav Virginica can be along the borders.</p>

<p>Darwin Tulips, such as Clara Butt, Dream, Gretchen,
La Tristesse, La Tulipe Noire, Mrs. Potter Palmer,
Philippe de Commines, Psyche, Rev. Ewbank, Suzon,
should be planted in more shaded places.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<h2>SECTION XVII</h2>

<h3>MEASUREMENTS, MAP MAKING
AND KNOTS</h3>


<div class='center'><br /><b>1. MEASUREMENTS</b></div>

<p>Every country has national standards of measures and
weights which are made and kept by the governments
as patterns, for measuring and comparing the instruments
made for business purposes. The units of measure have
been fixed by law, for it is most important that people
and countries in dealing with each other shall know exactly
what is meant by such words as yard, foot, pint
and pound.</p>

<p>The unit of length used in this country is the yard. It
is divided into three feet and each foot into twelve inches.
The foot refers to the length of a man's foot. It is said
that the length of the yard was based upon the length of
the arm of an English king, but that sounds like a fairy
tale. Many of our units of distance and weight have
been borrowed from the English and are more complicated
than those used by the French, whose unit of length
is the meter. In 1799, or thereabouts, an international
convention met at Paris to decide what the exact length
of a meter should be, for several countries at that time
were using what was known as the Metric System of
Weights and Measures. It was finally agreed that the
length of a meter should be equal to one ten-millionth
of the distance on the earth's surface, from the pole to
the equator, or 39.37 inches.</p>

<p>At the same convention a unit of weight was determined.
Because water is so important and familiar it was
chosen as the basis for this unit. A cube of water at 40
centigrade, and measuring on each edge 1/100 of a meter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
was taken and called a gram, which is about equal to 15
of our grains.</p>

<p>All peoples find it necessary in the house, out in the
open and in nearly all forms of occupation to measure
and weigh in order to accomplish their work.</p>

<p>It is part of a Scout's preparedness to know how to
measure and weigh and how to judge measurements and
numbers without using measures and weights.</p>

<p>There are rules for determining length and weight, and
it is important to understand them. Measuring a distance
means to find out the length of the straight line from one
point to another. To get a straight line in the open when
walking fix the eyes upon two objects directly in front,
one nearer and smaller than the other. With eyes high
walk toward these objects keeping them always in line.
When approaching the first one choose another to take
its place in line with it and the second. Always have two
objects in direct line with the eyes.</p>

<p>This method can be used in marching, rowing, swimming,
and when staking out the points of triangles for
measuring distance and height, as it will give the shortest
distance between two points.</p>

<p>There are three general methods of measuring distance
accurately. (1) chaining or taping; (2) telemetry, and
(3) triangulation. Less accurate means of measuring are
by sound, pacing and timing.</p>

<p>(1) Chaining and Taping. The regulation chain or
tape used by surveyors is 100 feet long. A Scout may
use a shorter line but must follow the same rules.</p>

<p>Three things must be kept in mind when using a line.
a. The straight distance between two points is to be obtained.
b. The point where the end of the line comes
each time must be marked. c. The line must be stretched
tight.</p>

<p>This method can be used in measuring off the distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
for pacing to obtain the average length of one's pace, as
suggested in a later paragraph under Useful Personal
Measurements.</p>

<p>(2) Telemetry. The second method is used in determining
long distances for artillery practice and in surveying.
It is called telemetry and the use of an instrument
is necessary.</p>

<p>(3) Triangulation. This is a long word but one a
Scout can learn to know and use. It means that the
length of the distance can be computed by means of
triangles staked out on the ground, when to measure
with a line would be impossible or not satisfactory. It
is not necessary to make the sides of the triangles, only
the points need to be indicated as it is the relative position
of the points which make a triangle and not the lines.
These can be marked in the country with poles, stakes
or stones; in the city Scouts could stand in position at the
necessary points.</p>

<p>When using triangles where shall a Scout place the
points?</p>

<p>If the width of a stream, road or field is wanted
choose a place where its sides are on about the same
level and if possible fairly straight. Then proceed as
shown in the accompanying diagram A. Select a conspicuous
object on the farther bank of the stream, such as a
tree, bush or stone and call it X. Stand opposite it at the
near edge of the stream or on the bank, and place a
stake A in front of you keeping X and A in direct line,
walk backward a few feet and plant a stake B in direct
line with them. Right or left face&mdash;(for a right angle
is necessary at this point). Pace a straight line for say
20 feet and plant a stake C, one high enough to be plainly
seen; continue the straight line for say 10 feet more and
plant a stake D. Turn inland, (another right angle
is here necessary) and pace to the point where the ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>ject
X on the far side of the stream can be seen in direct
line with the stake C. At this point place stake E.
Measure the distance from E to D. With paper and
pencil mark down the example&mdash;for such it is&mdash;in this
way:</p>

<div class='center'>
DC : CB :: DE : BX<br />
or<br />
as the length from D to C is to the length of C to B<br />
so<br />
is the length from D to E to the length from B to X<br />
or as in this example,<br />
</div>

<p>as 10 is to 20 so 8 is to the distance from B to X, which
would be 16. Having discovered the distance between A
and B in the case given, to be 4 feet, take this from the
distance between B and X and the result will give the
width of the stream, which is 12 feet.</p>

<span class="caption">Diagram A. To Measure Width of Stream or Road</span>
</div>

<p>It may not be always necessary to use the line A&mdash;B
but if the edge of the stream or road is crooked it is
necessary in order to make B&mdash;D a straight line at right
angles to A&mdash;X.</p>

<p>In calculating a height, as that of a tree, house or
tower, the triangles can again be used, as shown in
diagram B. Choose a level strip of ground; pace the
distance in a straight line, from the base of the tree A, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
tower, to a point some distance from the tree, and plant
a pole or stake say 5 feet high B; continue pacing the
straight line to the point where, lying down with eyes
level with the tree base, the top of the tree can be seen
on a line with the top of the pole; plant here stake C.
The height of the tree AA' will be to the length of the
distance from C to A as the height of the pole, BB' is to
the distance between B and C. A Scout can stand in the
place of the stake B.</p>

<span class="caption">Diagram C. To Measure Height with a Mirror</span>
</div>

<p>There are other ways of determining height. As
shown in the diagram C, place a mirror (M) horizontally
on the ground reflector side up, some distance from the
base of the object to be measured, in this case a tent.
Walk backward from the mirror in a straight line until
the top of the tent pole can be seen in it. The problem
will read in this way: the distance from the mirror to
your heels (MS) is to the distance from your heels to
your eyes (GS) as the distance from the mirror to the
base of the object (MT) is to the height of the object
(TT'). Water in a dark pan or tray or a pool on a still
day will answer for a mirror.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i135.png" width="118" height="125" alt="Diagram D. To Test a Right Angle" title="" />
<span class="caption">Diagram D. To Test a Right Angle</span>
</div>

<p>A right angle can be tested by measuring off 3 feet on
one side of the corner and 4 feet on the other side, as
shown in diagram d. If the distance between the two
points is 5 feet the angle is true; if not 5 feet move one
point as much as is necessary to make 5 feet.</p>

<p>South American natives estimate height fairly correctly
by turning the back to the object, walking straight
away from it to the point where the top of the object
can be seen by bending over and looking between the
legs. Plant a peg at this point and the distance from the
peg to the base of the object is roughly equal to the
height.</p>

<p>Sound travels at the rate of 365 yards every second,
as many yards as there are days in the year. By counting
the seconds between seeing the flash from a gun,
or the steam puff from a locomotive and hearing the
sound of the explosion or whistle it is possible to figure
the length of the distance between yourself and the gun
or locomotive.</p>

<p>It is said that the number of seconds between a flash of
lightning and the thunder will give the distance between
you and the place where the lightning struck.</p>

<p>We use weighing machines or scales in buying food, so
that we may compare the actual amount of food we buy
with a standard weight, otherwise there would be much
confusion and business could not be carried on between
peoples. For this reason we use pint, quart, peck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
bushel measures, all of which are regulated by law as to
the amount they hold.</p>

<p>There are some people who have a true feeling or
sense for weight and can tell almost to an ounce the
weight of a parcel by lifting it. Others have a good
memory and can tell the weight of a quantity by looking
at it. Others know distance and can estimate it correctly
without use of rule or measure, and likewise judge numbers.</p>

<p>Very few people have this ability naturally, but many
have acquired it by practice and patience and a Scout
can do so: she will find many times that this particular
form of knowledge whether in or out of doors is of
benefit.</p>

<p>How often a housekeeper wishes she could tell about
how much material to buy for this or that purpose without
getting the yard stick and measuring. The seamstress
and dressmaker must judge length and width and even
height, and the cook constantly has need of a sense of
quantity and size. The photographer, the pioneer, the
camper, all must know measurements. This matter of
judging is something we are called upon to do much
more than we have realized. The point is how can we
learn the trick? We should start with something we
know and compare to it something whose size we do not
know. This is where knowing your personal measurement
will be of value. Always prove when practicing
your idea, otherwise you will not improve your ability.
That is, make your estimate, then see how near right it is
by measuring. Learn to know how an inch, a foot, a yard
look. Then work with longer lengths out of doors with
several feet, and several yards. Fences, roads, streets,
dooryards, houses, all can be judged as to length.</p>

<p>Height is less easy to estimate for we are not so accustomed
to looking up and down as we are to looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
forward or back and forth, but the same rules hold good.
Learn to know the height of a chair seat, a table, your
own height, a room, a house, trees: by measuring and
looking, and looking and measuring, you will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'accomlish'">accomplish</ins>
much.</p>

<p>To learn to judge weight begin by holding in your hand
something that weighs a pound; after holding it a few
moments put it down and then take it up again always
trying to sense the weight. Do not use your eyes, only
your hand. Try a two pound weight and so on. Then
take up something else the weight of which you do not
know and see if you can tell its weight. Practice, patience
and memory are necessary in this work.</p>

<p>There is another way of judging weight, one in which
our eyes help us. Knowing how a pound of butter looks
as to size we can judge the weight of a mass of butter by
looking at it and comparing it mentally with what we
know. We can follow this method in judging the weight
of different goods, but as each kind when put in pound
quantities looks more or less different from every other
kind, experience and knowledge of the character of the
goods is necessary. A pound of butter and a pound of
feathers do not make the same size bundle so the weight
of each could not be judged by the same eye standard.</p>

<p>By practice a Girl Scout should be able to do the following
things in the way of judging height, weight and distance:</p>

<div class="hang1">(1) Be able to judge within 25 per cent the following:
Height of a tree, house, pole, etc., not exceeding
50 feet. Material, 1, 3, 15, 18, 27, 30, 36,
42 and 56 inches. Diameter of the trunk of a
tree, a pole, water pipe or similar object. Distance
of 6, 10, 15, 25 and 100 feet. (This is useful in
camera work.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></div>


<div class='hang1'>(2) Pick out from a miscellaneous assortment bottles
of 2, 4, 6 and 8 ounces. Bottles of 1 pint, 1 quart,
1 gallon. Pails, 1 pint, 1 quart, 2 quarts, 1 gallon.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(3) Be able without scales to weigh out specified
amounts of sugar, flour or other household materials,
for example, 1, 5 or 10 pounds.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(4) Be able to pick out from an assortment, packages
of rice, tea, cornmeal, etc., weighing 1/2, 1, 2, 5
and 10 pounds.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(5) Be able to give in the usual measures, either
avoirdupois or metric, capacity of the standard
teaspoon, tablespoon, teacup.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(6) Be able to tell when you have walked a mile in
open country. This may be done by using Scout's
Pace for 12 minutes, on a fifty walk, fifty run
rhythm, or by knowing one's own walking step
length.</div>

<div class='hang1'>(7) Be able to judge of spaces between distant objects
such as the distance between two trees, the
width of a road, or a brook, by the triangulation
method.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>USEFUL PERSONAL MEASURES</b></div>

<p>It is sometimes a great convenience to measure a length
of ribbon, lace or other goods without the use of a rule
or tape measure; but what shall we use in their place?
Look at your thumb&mdash;how long is it from the end to the
first joint? And the middle finger, from the end to the
knuckle on the back of the hand? Isn't it nearly four and
one-half inches or one-eighth of a yard? That is what
the average grown person's finger measures. To get the
correct length of your finger, hold the end of a tape
line to the end of the finger with the thumb of the same
hand, draw the tape measure tight over the bent finger to
the knuckle. This is a very useful measure for short
lengths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<p>Another measure for longer lengths is the distance
from the end of your nose, when your head is turned
sharply to one side, to the end of your thumb when your
arm is stretched straight out from the shoulder in the
opposite direction. Measure and find out this distance
for yourself by holding the very end of a ribbon, tape or
rope with the left hand to the end of the nose, head
turned to the left, and with the right hand run the fingers
along the edge of the ribbon until it is stretched to arm's
length. Marking the ribbon with a pin where the right
thumb and forefinger have held it, measure the distance
with a yard measure or rule from the end of the ribbon
to the pin. This length will be about the same as the
standard unit of length used in this country. When measuring
a long length of goods, use the point held by the
right hand as the starting point to be held by left hand.</p>

<p>If you know the distance between the end of your little
finger and the end of your thumb when they are stretched
apart, the palm of the hand being flat, you can measure
a distance such as the length of a table, shelf, pole,
etc. When judging the height of a person, remember that
the distance from the top of the head to the chin is about
one-ninth of the height of the body. The distance between
the middle fingers when the arms are stretched
straight out from the shoulders is about equal to the
height of the body.</p>

<p>Another personal measure that is of value is the length
of one's average pace or stride; that is, the distance from
the toe of one boot to the toe of the other when walking
a natural gait. It is also useful to know the average
number of paces taken in walking a given distance, such
as a mile, and the time required to make them. All of
this information can be obtained in a very simple way.
Measure off as accurately as possible 220 yards, which is
one-eighth of a mile, or take a known distance, and pace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
it back and forth at least eight times, but not all in one
day. Each time keep a record of the number of paces
taken and the time required to pace the distance. Divide
the sum of the paces by the number of times paced and
the result will be the average number of paces for the
distance. Then divide the whole distance by the average
number of paces and get the average length of your
pace. Divide the sum of the minutes spent in pacing the
distance by the number of times paced, and get the average
length of time required to walk the distance. When
the average length of pace is known, the distance between
two points can be quite accurately estimated by pacing, if
the ground is open, level and solid. If up or down grade,
if the ground is muddy or heavy, or there are other
causes which retard the gait, a reduction must be made.</p>

<p>None of the above methods for measuring are scientific,
therefore are not accurate, but they are useful ways
of measuring <i>approximately</i> lengths and distances by
means of a guide always at hand.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>2. MAP MAKING FOR GIRL SCOUTS</b></div>

<p>The word map calls to our mind a picture of lines,
angles, dots and circles which tell us something about a
position of the surface of the earth. It gives us an idea
of distance and direction, indicates heights and sometimes
tells of interesting land conditions. What we see are
but symbols representing a more or less true picture.
This method of telling a story is very old; as long ago
as 1370 B. C. it was used to show the location of the then
famous Nubian Gold Mines. This ancient map is now
preserved in the Museum of Turin.</p>

<p>Later, in 611 B. C. the first map of the world was
made&mdash;the world as men knew it then. They thought
it was like a hollow cylinder and surrounded by a river.
By 276 B. C. maps were used and understood quite generally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>They were named originally after the material upon
which they were painted or drawn. Map from Mappa,
meaning cloth, and chart from charta, meaning parchment.
Even today maps are made on cloth when for
use in the open by cyclists, military men, and so forth,
and charts are those maps filling the needs of seamen.
Savage tribes used maps made of horn, bone and wood.</p>

<p>In the 15th century the first printed maps were made
and now many processes are used in reproducing these
valuable and necessary graphic pictures, every line and
dot of which have been made out of someone's experience.
The explorer, the pioneer, the navigator, all contributing
to the store of knowledge of the earth's surface,
and many times having thrilling adventures, surviving terrible
conditions that the earth may be known as it really
appears.</p>

<p>Although maps are made to scale and every distance
computed most accurately by the use of very fine instruments,
Scouts can accomplish the real purpose of maps
in a small and simple way, for they are after all, but
guides to those who follow.</p>

<p>Knowing a delightful road or trail, one can by a map
guide others to it, or by making a map of a city, or country
district helps a stranger to find his way about. Our
maps must contain as the all important features: Direction,
Distance, Points of Identification, and the explanation
on the margin of the map of all symbols or conventional
signs used. For hiking purposes a starting-point
and a goal are necessary, all cross-roads must be indicated&mdash;streams,
bridges, trails, springs, points of interest, vantage
points for extended views, and so forth.</p>

<p>A city map should note beside streets, the car lines or
bus lines, public buildings, library, churches, hotels,
stores, police station, public telephone booths, a doctor's
office, fire alarm box and post box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p>A village map should show in addition the way to the
nearest large town or city, give the railroad station, and
so forth.</p>

<p>Direction is shown by symbol, an arrow or a line with
an N pointing to the North, which should be at the top of
the map, and all lines and signs should be made in relation
to it.</p>

<p>Distance is shown by what is known as scale. It would
be impossible and unnecessary in making a map to use the
exact measurements of distances existing in any given
portion of the country, but we can indicate those distances
by drawing our map even though very small so that lines,
angles, circles and dots will bear the same relation to each
other as the points they represent bear to each other.
This is done by using a small measure to represent a large
measure. If 1 inch was used to represent a mile, a map
showing 80 square miles of ground, measuring 8&times;10
miles could be drawn on a comparatively small piece of
paper. Whatever scale is used must be noted on the map,
however.</p>

<p>The true distances are found by pacing or by triangulation.
The interesting, helpful and necessary points are
learned by observation. These are the real guides when
using a map and these should be placed most correctly.
Some of the symbols most generally used in map making
are shown in the accompanying cut.</p>

<p>To be able to read a map is quite as important as making
one. Signs must be understood, distances read, and
directions known. It will help in ascertaining the latter
point to hold the map so its position will be true to the
points of the compass&mdash;the East to the East. This is
called orienting a map.</p>

serve in guiding a stranger truly, can be made very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
quickly and easily if the district sketched has been observed
closely. Observation is at the root of map making.</p>

<p>The reproduced sketch of a map made by Girl Scout,
will be a guide to the Scout who is learning how to tell
a story by symbols.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>THE COMPASS</b></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Mariner's Compass is an instrument which shows where
the North, and other directions, are. Boxing the Compass consists

<div class='center'><br /><b>How to Find Points of Compass Without a Compass</b></div>

<p>Every Scout should be able to find the North without a compass.
By day the sun will tell you where the North is, and the
stars by night.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>How to Tell the Points of the Compass by the Sun</b></div>

<p>The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Any time before
noon, if you stand facing the sun, North is at your left hand:
after noon, if you face the sun, North is at your right hand.</p>

<p>The Phoenicians, who sailed round Africa in ancient times,
noticed that when they started the sun rose on their left-hand
side&mdash;they were going south. Then they reported that they got to
a strange country where the sun got up in the wrong quarter,
namely on their right hand. The truth was that they had gone
round the Cape of Good Hope and were steering north again up
the coast of Africa.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i139.png" width="400" height="398" alt="Mariner&#39;s Compass" title="" />
</div>

<p>Probably the most accurate way to find North, if you have
no compass, is to use an open-faced watch. Holding the watch
flat, turn it so that the small or hour hand points directly toward
the sun. The South will then be half way between the hour hand
and the figure XII on the dial. Before noon the halfway point is
between the hour hand and XII clockwise, and after noon it is
between the hour hand and XII counter-clockwise.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>How to Find North by the Stars</b></div>

<p>All stars appear to rise in the east and set in the west, which
is really due to our earth turning around under them. But one
star never moves in relation to us, and that is Polaris, the North
Star, which stands still over the north pole to show us where North
is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>3. KNOTS AND THEIR USES FOR GIRL SCOUTS</b></div>

<p>It doubtless seems very strange to you that a Girl
Scout should have to know how to handle a rope and
tie knots according to rules. Most people have never
dreamed that there are rules for these things; they have
made knots, when necessary, in a way peculiar to themselves
and have been quite surprised that the knots come
out when they are expected to hold fast and hold fast
when they are expected to come out.</p>

<p>Ropes and knots have been in use by all peoples for
many years. The rules concerning them have been developed
and perfected as time has passed until now
there is no question as to the usefulness of these things
and the way to handle them correctly.</p>

<p>As the sailors and the engineers have worked with
ropes and knots more than others, it is to them that we
go for our information. We need all we can get, for today
in nearly all forms of occupation twine, cord and
rope are used and knots are tied. As the Girl Scout
who wants to be a Golden Eaglet takes up many of these
occupations, she needs to know how to tie knots quickly,
in the dark if necessary, and correctly, for then they
will hold fast yet can be readily untied. These are
essential requirements to be remembered, but just as
important is the fact that purposes and uses of knots
differ greatly.</p>

<p>Every Scout should have five feet of one-quarter inch
Manila rope, whipped at both ends. With this small
piece, which only represents the much larger rope needed
in many cases for practical purposes, all of the required
knots can be made and nearly all of their uses demonstrated.</p>

<p>Have you ever made a blanket roll, put it across your
shoulder, hiked through the woods or over the hills for
a sleep in the open? Where would all your necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
articles have been if you had not tied them snugly in the
roll? Without them you would have been far from
happy.</p>

<p>Or have you pulled a sled up a long hill over and
over again for the sake of the slide down? How about
the little knots that held the rope in place&mdash;did you ever
think of them? There are many things we do for the
sake of a good time where knots and rope are indispensable.</p>

<p>An interesting story is told by a Girl Scout who
watched two men trying to hang a very large and heavy
curtain which was to be used as part of the stage setting
for an entertainment. The men tried to tie two ropes
together, one of which was considerably larger than
the other. Every knot they tied was pulled out by
the weight of the curtains. Finally the men were quite
ready to say "It cannot be done." It was then that
the Girl Scout offered her services. The men looked
at her doubtfully, but said, "Go ahead." Of course she
tied a knot that held fast; then she had to teach it to
the men. You see, she could be helpful, for she knew
the kind of knot that would hold two ropes of unequal
thickness together and knew how to make it.</p>

<p>Did you ever notice how few people know how to
tie bundles and packages securely and neatly? Yet this
is a most helpful thing to do. Parcels that go through
the post or by express are handled roughly and unless
tied with special care they are not delivered in good
condition.</p>

<p>Sometimes we find ourselves in the midst of unusual
surroundings where we can be of service if we know
what to do and how to do it. A Scout is sometimes
called upon to give First Aid, possibly to tie on splints,
a bandage, or a sling; or use a life-line.</p>

<p>Once a boat was swept over one of the lesser falls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
at Niagara. In it were three people&mdash;a father, mother
and their son. A group of men and women standing on
the bridge saw the accident; one of them ran for a rope
and threw the end over the side of the bridge calling
to those in the water to catch it. One succeeded, but
the rope slipped through his hands almost immediately
because there was neither a loop nor a knot to hold on to.</p>

</div>

<p>These stories, which are true, make us realize the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
importance of knowing something of ropes and knots,
that we may Be Prepared when our services are needed.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>Parts of a Rope</b></div>

<p>The three parts of a rope are:</p>

<div class="hang1">1. The End, the part used in leading;</div>

<div class="hang1">2. The Bight, a loop made by bending the rope back
on itself and holding it in place;</div>

<div class="hang1">3. The Standing Part, the long portion of the rope
not used when tying a knot.</div>


<div class='center'><br /><b>1. Square or Reef Knot</b></div>

<p>The name of the knot the purpose of which is to tie
together two ends of equal thickness, either to make
them fast or to lengthen a rope, is the Square or Reef
knot. It is made so that the ends come out alongside
of the standing part and the knot will not jam. It is
used when tying bundles, such as the blanket-roll, and
packages; for tying on splints, fastening the ends of a
sling or mending broken strings, ropes or cords, as shoestrings,
clotheslines, etc. It is the knot used more commonly
than any other.</p>

<p>To make the Square Knot:</p>

<p>Take an end in each hand;</p>

<p>Cross the end in the right hand over the end in the
left hand;</p>

<p>Bend it around the rope in the left hand;</p>

<p>Cross the end in the left hand over the end in the
right hand;</p>

<p>Bend it around the rope in the right hand;</p>

<p>Pull tight.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>2. Sheet-bend</b></div>

<p>Another knot that is used for tying two ends together,
generally those of unequal thickness, or for fastening an
end to a permanent loop, is the Sheet-bend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">2b. Sheet Bend: Drawn Tight</span>
</div>

<p>To make a Sheet-bend:</p>

<p>Make in the end of the larger rope a small bight or
use the permanent loop in its place;</p>

<p>Pass the end of the smaller rope up through the bight;</p>

<p>Under the bight;</p>

<p>Over the bight;</p>

<p>Under its own standing part;</p>

<p>Pull the loops tight.</p>

<p>This is the way the Girl Scout tied the rope together
for the stage hands.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><b>3. Bowline-Knot</b></div>

<p>If the people on the bridge at Niagara Falls had made
a Bowline-knot in the end of the rope before throwing
it as a life-line they might have saved one if not three
lives. A Bowline is used chiefly for hoisting and lowering;
it can be used for a halter or with the Sheet-bend in
making a guard-line or fence. It is a knot holding fast
a loop which can be made of any size and which will
not jam or give.</p>

<p>To make a Bowline-knot:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>Take the end in the right hand;</p>

<p>Draw the rope toward you over the palm of the left
hand, measuring off as much as is needed to make the
required size loop;</p>

<p>Drop the end;</p>

<p>Make a small bight in the palm of the left hand by
turning the rope toward the ends of the fingers;</p>

<p>Take the end in the right hand;</p>

<p>Pass it up through the bight;</p>

<p>Back of and around the standing part;</p>

<p>Down through the bight;</p>

<p>Pull the end and the rope forming the loop against
the standing part.</p>

<p>When the Bowline is used for hoisting or lowering
a person as in case of fire, the loop should be large
enough to be used as a seat; it should be passed over
the head and shoulders, the standing part in front of
the body, to be held on to with both hands.</p>

<p>When using a rope for a life-line:</p>

<p>Fasten securely one end to something that will not give.</p>

<p>Make a Bowline at the other end of the line large
enough to go over the head and shoulders;</p>

<p>Hold the knot in the right hand, the end toward you;</p>

<p>Take the standing part in the left hand, measure off
about three feet of rope;</p>

<p>Draw the rope toward you, pass it over the palm of
the right hand and hold fast.</p>

<p>Again measure off the same amount, draw the rope
toward you, pass it over the palm of the right hand, and
hold fast;</p>

<p>Continue this process until enough rope is coiled to
more than cover the distance to the person in the water.</p>

<p>Grasp the coil firmly in the right hand;</p>

<p>Hold the standing part in the left hand;</p>

<p>Draw the right arm back from the shoulder;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/i142.png" width="390" height="450" alt="3. Bowline" title="" />
<span class="caption">3. Bowline</span>
</div>

<p>Swing the arm forward and throw the coil out over
the water to the person in distress;</p>

<p>Make sure that the person in the water gets a firm
grasp on the rope;</p>

<p>Quickly take the standing part in both hands;</p>

<p>Pull on the rope with a hand over hand motion, keep
the line taut and pull the person to safety.</p>

<p>Do not make the mistake of throwing the coil "up";
throw it <i>out</i> over the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>The important points to remember when using a rope
for rescue work are to fasten the free end so the rope
will not slip out of reach; to coil the rope properly so
it will not kink or knot when let out; and to make a
Bowline large enough to go around the body.</p>

<p>When a group of Scouts make a guard line, each girl
makes a Bowline in the end of her rope, large enough
to put her hand through, fasten her right-hand neighbor's
rope to it by means of a Sheet-bend and holds her
portion of the line in place by using the Bowline in her
rope for a handle.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i143.png" width="425" height="252" alt="4. Two Half-Hitches" title="" />
<span class="caption">4. Two Half-Hitches</span>
</div>

<p>Two Half-hitches are used to make fast an end of
rope to a pole, post, etc. It is a knot that can be easily
undone. It is used for hauling, fastening awning ropes,
flag ropes, etc.</p>

<p>To make a Half-hitch:</p>

<p>Take the end in the right hand;</p>

<p>Pass the end under and around the pole;</p>

<p>Around the standing part:</p>

<p>Under itself, forming a bight out of which the standing
part comes. Repeat this for the second half-hitch,
using standing part in place of pole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/i144.png" width="270" height="450" alt="5. Clove-Hitch" title="" />
<span class="caption">5. Clove-Hitch</span>
</div>

<p>The purpose of a Clove-hitch, which is also called
the Builders' Knot, is to make fast an end of rope, generally
to a post or tree. This knot holds securely and
does not slip laterally. It is of value when tethering
an animal or tying a boat. It can be used for fastening
an awning rope, tent ropes, for tying on splints or fastening
the end of a bandage when it is used to confine a delirious
person.</p>

<p>A fence or guard-line can be made where trees or posts
are available by tying the end of the rope by means of
a Half-hitch to the first tree, and then using a Clove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>-hitch
on the other trees or posts.</p>

<p>To tie the Clove-hitch:</p>

<p>Take the end in the right hand;</p>

<p>Pass it around the post;</p>

<p>Over the standing part;</p>

<p>Continue around the post;</p>

<p>Under the standing part;</p>

<p>Slip the end up through the lower loop;</p>

<p>Pull tight.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
<img src="images/i145.png" width="435" height="241" alt="6. Sheep-Shank" title="" />
<span class="caption">6. Sheep-Shank</span>
</div>

<p>The purpose of a Sheep-shank is to take up slack or
shorten a rope temporarily. It is used on tent ropes,
tow lines.</p>

<p>To make the Sheep-shank:</p>

<p>Cross the hands and take hold of the rope;</p>

<p>Take up the slack by drawing the hands past each
other;</p>

<p>Hold the two long loops firmly in one hand;</p>

<p>Make a bight in the rope between the loop and the end;</p>

<p>Pass the loop through the bight;</p>

<p>Do the same thing at the other end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>The knot will stay in place so long as the rope is taut.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to shorten a rope when neither end
is held fast, make the Sheep-shank and pass each end
through the bight nearest to it.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i146.png" width="300" height="86" alt="Ready For Transportation or Storage" title="" />
<span class="caption">Ready For Transportation or Storage</span>
</div>

<p>When in uniform a Girl Scout hangs her rope on a
belt-hook placed in her belt or skirt-binding.</p>

<p><i>To have the rope in a convenient form:</i></p>

<p>Make two loops five or six inches long at one end
of the rope;</p>

<p>Leaving a small bight at the top to go over the hook,
bind the loops together by winding the standing part
around them;</p>

<p>Hold the end fast by putting it through the remaining
bight.</p>

<p><i>To serve or whip the ends of a Scout rope so they
will not fray:</i></p>

<p>Take a piece of soft twine twelve or fourteen inches
long;</p>

<p>Make a loop two inches long at one end;</p>

<p>Lay the loop on the rope, the end of the twine extending
beyond the rope end an inch;</p>

<p>Bind the rope and loop together by winding the standing
part tightly and closely around them;</p>

<p>Slip the end down through the loop, which must not
be entirely covered by the binding;</p>

<p>Pull the other end of the twine and draw the loop
under the binding.</p>

<p>As the twine will be held fast, the ends can be cut off
close to the rope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>A "knot board," showing the various knots tied perfectly
and names attached, ends of rope whipped, bights,
loops and coils, is an interesting bit of work for a Troop
of Girl Scouts to do. The board hung in the Troop
room would be a help to new Scouts, and it could be
loaned to Troops that are not registered, but are learning
the Tenderfoot test, which includes knot-tying.</p>

<h3><br />Proficiency Tests and Merit Badges</h3>

<div class='center'>1. INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>A girl must be a Second Class Scout before receiving a Merit Badge
in any subject. However, this does not mean that she cannot begin to
study her subject and plan for passing the test at any time.</p>

<p>Proficiency in these tests is to be determined by the Local Council,
or by persons competent (in the opinion of the Council) to judge it. If
no Local Council exists, certificates should be secured from persons
competent to judge each subject, such as teachers of music, dancing
or drawing, riding masters, motorists, electricians, milliners, dressmakers,
artists, craftsmen, scientists and so forth. These certificates
should be sent to the National Headquarters or to the nearest District
Headquarters for inspection. Headquarters will either pass on these,
or indicate the nearest local body competent to deal with them.</p>

<p>The tests as given are topical outlines of what a Scout should know
about the subject rather than formal questions. Captains and others
giving the tests will adapt the wording to the needs of the particular case.</p>

<p>With many subjects a list of standard references is given. It is
desirable that a girl should read at least one of these books, not in
order to pass an examination but that she may be familiar with the
general field and the great names and principles associated with it. Where
a whole troop is working on a subject, portions of the books may be read
at troop meetings, or several Scouts can read together and discuss their
impressions.</p>

<p>It is important that every Girl Scout should understand that the
winning of any one of the following Merit Badges does not mean that
she is a finished expert in the subject.</p>

<p>What does it mean then? It means three things:</p>

<div class="hang1">1. She has an intelligent interest in the subject</div>

<div class="hang1">2. She has a reasonable knowledge of its broad principles</div>

<div class="hang1">3. She is able to present some practicable proofs of her knowledge,
so that a competent examiner can see that she has not simply
"crammed it up" from a book. Doing, not talking or writing
is the principle of the Girl Scouts</div>

<p>One of the great things about these Merit Badges is that they require
a definite amount of perseverance. This is a quality in which women
are sometimes said to be lacking; if this is a fair criticism, the Merit
Badges will certainly test it.</p>

<p>Nobody compels any Scout to earn these Badges; she deliberately
chooses to do so. Therefore, to fail in a task she has voluntarily set herself,
comes straight back to her and shows her what stuff she is made of.
For while it is of no particular importance how many things you start
in this life, it is of great importance how many things you finish! Out
OF GOODNESS of heart, or quick interest, or sudden resolution, a girl will
start out to master a subject, earn a certain sum of money, make something
for herself or someone else, form some good habit or break some bad
one; and after her first enthusiasm has died out, where is she? So that
a great many people laugh at a girl's plans&mdash;and with reason.</p>

<p>Now while this may be merely amusing, so long as it affects only the
girl herself, it becomes very annoying when other people's affairs are
involved, and may be positively dangerous if carried too far. If your
life depended upon a Girl Scout's efforts to resuscitate you from drowning,
you would be very glad if she stuck to it. But if she happened to be a
girl who had started to win five different Merit Badges, and had given
them all up, half way through, what sort of chance do you think you would
have?</p>

<p>Girl Scouts are slower to begin than other girls, perhaps, but they
stick to it till they've made good. "She carried that through like a Girl
Scout" ought to become a common saying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

impossible for the organization to lay down strict requirements in
these subjects.</p></div>

<h2>SECTION XIX</h2>

<h3>REFERENCE READING FOR GIRL
SCOUTS</h3>

<p>The following books have been selected for the Girl Scouts with two
ideas in mind: first, to list some of the best books of the world, with
which all persons should be familiar, and second, to give books that should
easily be available in all parts of the country. In some cities the Public
Libraries have "Girl Scout Shelves." Has your library one? In some
places the Libraries have Reading Clubs for young people, conducted
by the boys and girls themselves under the guidance of specially trained
librarians who know just how to help bring the right book to hand, on
any subject a Scout would be interested in. In Manhattan there are no
less than thirty such clubs in connection with the various district
libraries. Why not have one of these in your town?</p>

<p>The American Library Association, whose headquarters are in Chicago,
Ill., at 78 East Washington Street, will help to bring books to rural districts
and places without regular public libraries. Write to them for
help if you need it.</p>

<p>The Congressional Library may be called upon at any time for bibliography
on any special topic.</p>

<p>The books in this section are in addition to the special references for
Proficiency Tests in <a href="#proficiency">Section XVIII</a>.</p>

<div class='center'><br /><b>FOR CAPTAINS, LIEUTENANTS, COMMISSIONERS AND
OTHER GIRL SCOUT OFFICERS</b></div>

<p>After a thorough study of Scouting for Girls, the authorized American
Handbook, Scout Captains and Lieutenants are urged to read the following
list of allied Handbooks for Leaders as containing many practical hints
for workers with young people, and emphasizing the essential unity of
these movements.</p>

<p>A study of these manuals will bring out very clearly the fact that though
our methods of approach and phraseology may differ in certain instances,
our ultimate aim and our broad general principles are precisely the
same.</p>

<p>The books in the following list which have been starred are recommended
as particularly practical for all students and friends of young
people. They represent the latest thought of the greatest authorities
on the subjects most closely allied with the sympathetic study of adolescence.
It is impossible to isolate a study of the girlhood of America
from the kindred topics of women in industry and politics, the growth
of the community spirit, the present theories of education, and in general
a brief survey of economics, sociology and psychology.</p>

<p>Many of these titles appear technical and dry, but the books have been
carefully selected with a view to their readable and stimulating qualities,
and no one need be a profound student in order to understand and
appreciate them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>It is especially advisable that Leaders in the Girl Scout organization
should be reasonably well informed as to the principal social movements
of the day so as to relate the effective organization of the
young people of the country with corresponding progress along other
lines. The more broadly cultivated our Captains and Councillors become,
the more vital and enduring will be the work of the Girl Scouts,
and this breadth of view cannot be obtained from the knowledge and
practice of what might be called the "technique of Scouting" alone.</p>

<p>The Woodcraft Section of <span class="smcap">Scouting For
Girls</span> gives the Girl Scout a taste of one of
the jolliest, most readable books about the
out of door life that any girl can have: "<i>The
Woodcraft Manual for Girls</i>," by Ernest
Thompson Seton, published by Doubleday
Page and Company for the Woodcraft League
Of America, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. Seton has long been loved by the young
people of many countries for his marvelous
understanding of animals and their homes,
and in this book he has shared his secrets with
the boys and girls of America; so that any
Girl Scout who wants to be sure of herself on
the trail and equipped for all emergencies of
the woods, could add no better guide book to
her Troop or personal life than this one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span></p>

<div class='tnote'><h3>Transcriber's Notes:</h3>
<p>Obvious punctuation errors repaired.</p>

<p>Page numbering inconsistencies. Images were moved out of paragraphs so as to not interrupt the flow of
reading. For the text version, this made little difference. However, in this html edition, it may mean that some page
numbers are not visible, while others are out of order. Every attempt has been made to make this as
logical and easy on the reader as possible.</p>

<p>Page 506, number 5 on the list was omitted. This was retained.</p>
<p>Page 518, original list under "5. Keep Clean:" went from b to d, omitting c. List was reordered.</p>

<p>Page 553, in original text, entry for "Hornung" came after "Johnson, Owen". This was repaired.</p>
<p>Page 543, the list of books restarts alphabetically after Woolson.</p>
<p>Page 546, the entry  Woods was originally located between Terman and Trotter. This was repaired.</p>
<p>Page 552, in original text, entry for "Position" came after "Posture". This was repaired.</p>
<p>Page 553, in original text, entry for "Sharks" came after "Shovel". This was repaired.</p>

<p>Page 553, entries for "Sick bed" and "Sick, care of" were repeated in the original text. They have been
deleted.</p>

<p>Page 553, in original text, entries for "Steps" and "Stew" came before "Stars". This was repaired.</p>

<p>Page 553, entries for "Thistle" and "Thrushes" were repeated in the original text. They have been
deleted.</p>

<p>Page 554, in original text, entry for "Water dog" came before "Water and game". This was repaired.</p>
